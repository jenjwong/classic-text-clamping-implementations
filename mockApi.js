But how bad? A new educational video claims there may be more benefits to relatives mating than we tend to believe. Science reporter Anna Rothschild tackled the issue in her latest episode of Gross Science - after swathes of her viewers wrote in asking why incest was bad. Breaking it down, she admitted there is a case for inbreeding as a way to protect good genes. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO Science reporter Anna Rothschild tackled the issue of inbreeding in her latest episode of Gross Science - after swathes of her viewers wrote in asking why incest was bad First Rothschild outlines all the ways in which inbreeding is dangerous. It maximizes the chances that a child inherits recessive genes that cause deformity, disease, and other developmental problems. 'That being said, mating with partners who aren't genetically similar to you is risky too,' she says. RELATED ARTICLES Share this article Share 'If your traits make you really well-suited to your environment, why mess with a good thing by mating with someone whose genes might be super different? 'If instead you mate with a relative, whose genes are similar to yours, you may be ensuring that those good traits get passed on.' However, Rothschild emphasizes that for humans and many other organisms the dangers prevail. The benefits are only really enjoyed by certain species, such as some kinds of fig wasps, she says. Rothschild explains that is because male offspring of fig wasps only inherit genes from their mother, meaning that it is hard to mask any recessive genes in the gene pool.

"text": "e-mail \nView \ncomments\nFor an industry that prides itself on being the arbiter of cool, heralding new trends before we even know we want them, it has got this one terribly, terribly wrong. \nI witnessed it first hand over the weekend at London Fashion Week in all its ugly glory: malnourished models being celebrated and glorified once again. \nAs a magazine writer and editor, I’ve been watching the shows for 18 years. \nMalnourished models were being celebrated once again at London Fashion Week - in particular at the Versus show (pictured) \nAnd while there have been times when it looked as if we might be putting this fixation with skinny behind us - that fashion bosses might have abandoned their obsession with ‘heroin chic’ when super-skinny models looked as though they’d just been hauled out of a drug-infested squat - I’m bitterly disappointed to report that we’re back to the bad old days. \nThe fashions may have evolved. But the size of the skinniest models hasn’t moved an inch. And the question that urgently needs to be asked is, why? \nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next 'They're not going to date in photos': Designer Rachel Riley... ¿He¿s nothing to me now': Beautician left disfigured in an... Share this article Share After all, weren’t we making progress? Size 16 models, although by no means ubiquitous, were being used by some designers - Dolce and Gabbana, H&M and M&S, to name but a few - in a bid to silence the critics and celebrate a healthy version of the female form. \nEven Victoria Beckham, whose New York show last week came under fire for her use of waif-like models, claimed in 2010 to have banned ‘terribly thin’ models from her castings. \nIndustry insiders said that t he trend towards super-skinny had been reignited by the fact so many people today are curvy, if not obese (pictured, the Antonio Berardi show this week)\nHigh-end fashion needs to be exclusive to survive, so designers want their brands to be about more than just clothes (pictured, models Jourdan Dunn and Cara Delevingne)\nSo I asked industry insiders what has gone wrong. And the answer, almost universally, was that the trend towards super-skinny had been reignited by the fact so many people today are curvy, if not obese. \nHigh-end fashion needs to be exclusive to survive, so designers want their brands to be about more than just clothes. By buying designer clothes, you get to join an exclusive club of the super wealthy, where labels - and skinniness - are your route in. \nAs the poorest in society get fatter - thanks to the fact it’s much cheaper to eat badly - the relationship between wealth and extreme slenderness has deepened. \nBIG DEAL London Fashion Week leads to £100 million worth of clothing orders, according to the British Fashion Council. \nIt’s no coincidence Vogue boss Anna Wintour and Mrs Beckham have shrunk in the past ten years. Being thin is, first and foremost, a marker of wealth. As Catherine Riley, spokesperson for the Women’s Equality Party, established last year to campaign for gender equality, says: ‘There is almost an exclusivity around thinness - it has become aspirational.’ \nThis view is echoed by Denise Hatton, chief executive of YMCA England and founding partner of the Be Real Campaign for body confidence, who expressed concern over what appears to be ‘a re-emergence of ultra-thin models at Fashion Week.’ \nShe adds: ‘Fashion Week events are beamed to millions around the world, and the danger is some of the images may perpetuate a myth around how women should look. In reality, the body types of many of the models are unobtainable for 95 per cent of the population.’ \nAs the poorest in society get fatter - thanks to the fact it’s much cheaper to eat badly - the relationship between wealth and extreme slenderness has deepened (pictured, a model from the Antonio Berardi show)\nWhich again goes to explain the allure of belonging to that exclusive minority. Let’s also not forget the fact that, as fears of a worldwide recession grow, the luxury market is fighting to survive. \nThanks to an economic slowdown in the Middle East and China (sales of personal luxury goods - from handbags and shoes to clothes - have slumped in the past three years), many brands are struggling as never before. Burberry and Mulberry, for example, both recently posted dire profits. \nThe emphasis is on doing everything to ensure their core clients - the super wealthy - are happy. On the whole, this group cares little for the models’ wellbeing or the effect it has on society. Every designer house is desperate to corner this very elite market. \nAnd, twisted though it may be, this group believes being thin is the easiest way to appear rich and desirable. \nSo, it follows that the more the designers can outdo their competitors on the skinny scale, the more they will be seen as fashionable and the more money they will make. \nBut of course, there are other factors at play. Debra Bourne, psychotherapist and co-founder of All Walks Beyond The Catwalk, an organisation championing diversity in fashion, says: ‘Designers are under pressure to break a new girl to attract attention. \nThe waif is here, too - predominantly at Donatella Versace’s Versus show. Issa Lish (pictured), a Mexican model with a 24 in waist, cut the gauntest of figures as she strode down the catwalk in knee-high boots that accentuated her skeletal legs\n‘Those girls are usually very young and their bones haven’t had time to develop properly. Their hips, in particular, are very small. \n‘The tragedy is they spend the rest of their careers chasing their pubescent weight, trying to get back to the time when they were “hot”. Their bodies may have developed, but they need to remain childlike in size.’ \nThen there’s the belief that clothes look much better on very skinny women. \nAs the poorest in society get fatter - thanks to the fact it’s much cheaper to eat badly - the relationship between wealth and extreme slenderness has deepened Stylist Alex Longmore says: ‘Designers want their models to be virtually transparent. A model’s job is to be a coat hanger, something for the clothes to hang off, uninterrupted by bottoms or breasts or curves.’ \nIt’s a view to which Chanel head Karl Lagerfeld has cheerfully admitted subscribing. \nWhen a German fashion magazine announced it was going to photograph ‘ordinary, realistic women’ in fashionable clothes recently, he called the decision ‘absurd’ and said it was driven by overweight women who did not like to be reminded of their weight issues. \n‘These are fat mummies sitting with their bags of crisps in front of the television, saying that thin models are ugly. The world of fashion is all dreams and illusions, and no one wants to see round women,’ he said. \nIndeed, on the London catwalk this week there was a notable handful of girls who have fallen below any normal arbiter of what is considered healthy. \nGirls who have legs so thin that their skin clings to their femurs. Girls with pallid, sunken cheeks and hips so fleshless that when they walk, you can see the outline of their hip joints. We first saw them at Victoria Beckham’s show in New York last week. Tiny, bird-like models with waists as slim as a child’s. But this was no blip. \nThe waif is here, too - predominantly at Donatella Versace’s Versus show. Issa Lish, a Mexican model with a 24 in waist, cut the gauntest of figures as she strode down the catwalk in knee-high boots that accentuated her skeletal legs. She wasn’t alone. \nOn the London catwalk this week there was a notable handful of girls who have fallen below any normal arbiter of what is considered healthy\nThen there’s the belief that clothes look much better on very skinny women, whose bodies serve as clothes hangers (pictured, model Stella Maxwell)\nPoor, starved, walking coat-hangers. And I use that phrase deliberately. British model Ayesha Tan Jones, 23, was one of these girls. \n‘I was signed up by an agency at the age of 14. I was very, very skinny. By the time I was 17, my body had matured, and I had put on some weight. I was a UK size 8 or 10. \n‘The agency told me to lose four inches in two weeks, and to go back to be weighed and measured when I’d done that. I felt that I wasn’t good enough. I was too scared and embarrassed to go back in. \n‘A few months later, they dropped me. I am sure that my weight played a part in that decision.’ \nAnother model, Rosie Nelson, was told by an agency they wanted her ‘down to the bone’. At 5ft 10in, she weighed 7st 8lb at her skinniest. She now weighs 8st 9lb, which is still technically underweight. \nShe says: ‘I know girls who just eat fruit - three apples a day - or exercise obsessively and cut out dairy, carbohydrates and sugar. \n‘I met a fashion model from London who ate cotton buds and tissue paper to take away her appetite. The use of these tactics peak during the shows, when there is a lot of pressure to be as thin as possible.’ \nRosie now does commercial work, rather than fashion modelling. She says: ‘I’ve realised I can’t do fashion work because I’m not thin enough.’ \nChanel head Karl Lagerfeld called it absurd when a German fashion magazine announced it was going to photograph ‘ordinary, realistic women’ in fashionable clothes recently and said it was driven by overweight women who did not like to be reminded of their weight issues\nIt seems that many other girls have similar experiences to Rosie’s, but won’t come forward for fear of losing out on big jobs. One model told me on the condition of anonymity: ‘Girls are too scared to speak out, but of course no model eats before Fashion Week. \n‘The pressure is immense. We live on cigarettes and coffee, and some girls use drugs or medication to suppress hunger pangs. It’s not healthy, but designers are after only one look - and that’s skin and bone.’ \nAs a woman and mother watching these shows, it’s impossible to apply any sort of aesthetic judgment to the clothes when the girl inside them is clearly unwell and needs help. \nI found myself wondering how any human being, fashion designers included, could believe that an emaciated creature with limbs so skeletal they can barely hold her upright, in any way represents a desirable female form? \nMany believe the fault lies with designers, who create sample sizes for their catwalk shows that are so tiny, only the thinnest models can wear them. And until the British Fashion Council (BFC) cracks down, it will continue. \nLib Dem MP Jo Swinson, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Body Image, is frustrated. \n‘We’ve had some successes, like Debenhams bringing in size 16 mannequins. But it’s not as if there has been a wholesale acceptance by large parts of the industry. \nIt’s no coincidence Vogue boss Anna Wintour and Mrs Beckham have shrunk in the past ten years. Being thin is, first and foremost, a marker of wealth\n‘Some organisations are trying to educate the next generation at fashion colleges, and that could produce lasting change. \n‘But isn’t it terrible that we worked so hard, from the suffragettes on, to get votes and jobs, and now women spend their time worrying about their weight.’ \nSo why, despite growing political pressure, hasn’t the British Fashion Council placed a ban on designers using any girl who falls below a certain weight? \nWhy are agencies, yet again, telling their already slender models that they must be thinner? \nFrance passed a law last year criminalising the use of ‘excessively thin’ models. Unless a model has a doctor’s certificate confirming she is healthy, designers face up to six months in jail and a £54,000 fine. \nBut here, the BFC continues to turn a blind eye to what amounts to the exploitation of young models and the promotion of a message to our daughters which is as unhealthy as smoking or binge-drinking. \nThere are 1.6 million sufferers of eating disorders in this country; 89 per cent of them are women and young girls, with the 14-25 age group worst affected. \nTom Quinn, director of external affairs, at Beat (Beating Eating Disorders), believes the fashion industry is partly to blame. \nTiny, birdlike models with waists as slim as a child’s were seen at Victoria Beckham's show in New York last week \n‘We are concerned about the pressures young females are placed under by the fashion industry,’ he says. ‘Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses, and poor body image and low self-esteem can be a key factor.’ \nHe adds: ‘We may not be able to change an individual’s biological make-up, but we can certainly challenge the toxic cultural ideals forced on our young people.’ \nThis week, our daughters have been watching shows streamed live by the fashion labels they revere, who are openly, arrogantly sabotaging any progress that’s been made. \nI met a fashion model from London who ate cotton buds and tissue paper to take away her appetite. The use of these tactics peak during the shows, when there is a lot of pressure to be as thin as possible I wish the bosses at the BFC could have been in the room when my 13-year-old daughter told me she was worried about her body because she doesn’t have a ‘thigh-gap’ - a space between her upper thighs. \nThen, to illustrate her point, she looked up the latest images from her favourite designers to find that the models don’t just have gaps, they have veritable canyons between their toothpick legs. \n‘See,’ she says, pointing at the photographs, ‘my legs should look like this!’ \nThe Women’s Equality Party is now running a campaign for changes similar to the new French laws, demanding that the model agencies hire only girls who have a minimum body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 (the cut-off point when a woman is considered to be clinically underweight). \n‘We continue to have young models coming to us with terrible eating problems, who have been told by their agencies that they need to get “down to the bone” before they can get a catwalk job,’ says Catherine Riley. \n‘These are girls who already have a BMI of 16 - which is seriously underweight - being told they have to lose even more.’ \nFor the sake of the girls on the catwalks - and the young girls around our kitchen tables - we can only hope this designer dystopia soon comes to an end.",
