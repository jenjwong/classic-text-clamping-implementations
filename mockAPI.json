But how bad? A new educational video claims there may be more benefits to relatives mating than we tend to believe. Science reporter Anna Rothschild tackled the issue in her latest episode of Gross Science - after swathes of her viewers wrote in asking why incest was bad. Breaking it down, she admitted there is a case for inbreeding as a way to protect good genes. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO Science reporter Anna Rothschild tackled the issue of inbreeding in her latest episode of Gross Science - after swathes of her viewers wrote in asking why incest was bad First Rothschild outlines all the ways in which inbreeding is dangerous. It maximizes the chances that a child inherits recessive genes that cause deformity, disease, and other developmental problems. 'That being said, mating with partners who aren't genetically similar to you is risky too,' she says. RELATED ARTICLES Share this article Share 'If your traits make you really well-suited to your environment, why mess with a good thing by mating with someone whose genes might be super different? 'If instead you mate with a relative, whose genes are similar to yours, you may be ensuring that those good traits get passed on.' However, Rothschild emphasizes that for humans and many other organisms the dangers prevail. The benefits are only really enjoyed by certain species, such as some kinds of fig wasps, she says. Rothschild explains that is because male offspring of fig wasps only inherit genes from their mother, meaning that it is hard to mask any recessive genes in the gene pool.

"text": "e-mail \nView \ncomments\nFor an industry that prides itself on being the arbiter of cool, heralding new trends before we even know we want them, it has got this one terribly, terribly wrong. \nI witnessed it first hand over the weekend at London Fashion Week in all its ugly glory: malnourished models being celebrated and glorified once again. \nAs a magazine writer and editor, I’ve been watching the shows for 18 years. \nMalnourished models were being celebrated once again at London Fashion Week - in particular at the Versus show (pictured) \nAnd while there have been times when it looked as if we might be putting this fixation with skinny behind us - that fashion bosses might have abandoned their obsession with ‘heroin chic’ when super-skinny models looked as though they’d just been hauled out of a drug-infested squat - I’m bitterly disappointed to report that we’re back to the bad old days. \nThe fashions may have evolved. But the size of the skinniest models hasn’t moved an inch. And the question that urgently needs to be asked is, why? \nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next 'They're not going to date in photos': Designer Rachel Riley... ¿He¿s nothing to me now': Beautician left disfigured in an... Share this article Share After all, weren’t we making progress? Size 16 models, although by no means ubiquitous, were being used by some designers - Dolce and Gabbana, H&M and M&S, to name but a few - in a bid to silence the critics and celebrate a healthy version of the female form. \nEven Victoria Beckham, whose New York show last week came under fire for her use of waif-like models, claimed in 2010 to have banned ‘terribly thin’ models from her castings. \nIndustry insiders said that t he trend towards super-skinny had been reignited by the fact so many people today are curvy, if not obese (pictured, the Antonio Berardi show this week)\nHigh-end fashion needs to be exclusive to survive, so designers want their brands to be about more than just clothes (pictured, models Jourdan Dunn and Cara Delevingne)\nSo I asked industry insiders what has gone wrong. And the answer, almost universally, was that the trend towards super-skinny had been reignited by the fact so many people today are curvy, if not obese. \nHigh-end fashion needs to be exclusive to survive, so designers want their brands to be about more than just clothes. By buying designer clothes, you get to join an exclusive club of the super wealthy, where labels - and skinniness - are your route in. \nAs the poorest in society get fatter - thanks to the fact it’s much cheaper to eat badly - the relationship between wealth and extreme slenderness has deepened. \nBIG DEAL London Fashion Week leads to £100 million worth of clothing orders, according to the British Fashion Council. \nIt’s no coincidence Vogue boss Anna Wintour and Mrs Beckham have shrunk in the past ten years. Being thin is, first and foremost, a marker of wealth. As Catherine Riley, spokesperson for the Women’s Equality Party, established last year to campaign for gender equality, says: ‘There is almost an exclusivity around thinness - it has become aspirational.’ \nThis view is echoed by Denise Hatton, chief executive of YMCA England and founding partner of the Be Real Campaign for body confidence, who expressed concern over what appears to be ‘a re-emergence of ultra-thin models at Fashion Week.’ \nShe adds: ‘Fashion Week events are beamed to millions around the world, and the danger is some of the images may perpetuate a myth around how women should look. In reality, the body types of many of the models are unobtainable for 95 per cent of the population.’ \nAs the poorest in society get fatter - thanks to the fact it’s much cheaper to eat badly - the relationship between wealth and extreme slenderness has deepened (pictured, a model from the Antonio Berardi show)\nWhich again goes to explain the allure of belonging to that exclusive minority. Let’s also not forget the fact that, as fears of a worldwide recession grow, the luxury market is fighting to survive. \nThanks to an economic slowdown in the Middle East and China (sales of personal luxury goods - from handbags and shoes to clothes - have slumped in the past three years), many brands are struggling as never before. Burberry and Mulberry, for example, both recently posted dire profits. \nThe emphasis is on doing everything to ensure their core clients - the super wealthy - are happy. On the whole, this group cares little for the models’ wellbeing or the effect it has on society. Every designer house is desperate to corner this very elite market. \nAnd, twisted though it may be, this group believes being thin is the easiest way to appear rich and desirable. \nSo, it follows that the more the designers can outdo their competitors on the skinny scale, the more they will be seen as fashionable and the more money they will make. \nBut of course, there are other factors at play. Debra Bourne, psychotherapist and co-founder of All Walks Beyond The Catwalk, an organisation championing diversity in fashion, says: ‘Designers are under pressure to break a new girl to attract attention. \nThe waif is here, too - predominantly at Donatella Versace’s Versus show. Issa Lish (pictured), a Mexican model with a 24 in waist, cut the gauntest of figures as she strode down the catwalk in knee-high boots that accentuated her skeletal legs\n‘Those girls are usually very young and their bones haven’t had time to develop properly. Their hips, in particular, are very small. \n‘The tragedy is they spend the rest of their careers chasing their pubescent weight, trying to get back to the time when they were “hot”. Their bodies may have developed, but they need to remain childlike in size.’ \nThen there’s the belief that clothes look much better on very skinny women. \nAs the poorest in society get fatter - thanks to the fact it’s much cheaper to eat badly - the relationship between wealth and extreme slenderness has deepened Stylist Alex Longmore says: ‘Designers want their models to be virtually transparent. A model’s job is to be a coat hanger, something for the clothes to hang off, uninterrupted by bottoms or breasts or curves.’ \nIt’s a view to which Chanel head Karl Lagerfeld has cheerfully admitted subscribing. \nWhen a German fashion magazine announced it was going to photograph ‘ordinary, realistic women’ in fashionable clothes recently, he called the decision ‘absurd’ and said it was driven by overweight women who did not like to be reminded of their weight issues. \n‘These are fat mummies sitting with their bags of crisps in front of the television, saying that thin models are ugly. The world of fashion is all dreams and illusions, and no one wants to see round women,’ he said. \nIndeed, on the London catwalk this week there was a notable handful of girls who have fallen below any normal arbiter of what is considered healthy. \nGirls who have legs so thin that their skin clings to their femurs. Girls with pallid, sunken cheeks and hips so fleshless that when they walk, you can see the outline of their hip joints. We first saw them at Victoria Beckham’s show in New York last week. Tiny, bird-like models with waists as slim as a child’s. But this was no blip. \nThe waif is here, too - predominantly at Donatella Versace’s Versus show. Issa Lish, a Mexican model with a 24 in waist, cut the gauntest of figures as she strode down the catwalk in knee-high boots that accentuated her skeletal legs. She wasn’t alone. \nOn the London catwalk this week there was a notable handful of girls who have fallen below any normal arbiter of what is considered healthy\nThen there’s the belief that clothes look much better on very skinny women, whose bodies serve as clothes hangers (pictured, model Stella Maxwell)\nPoor, starved, walking coat-hangers. And I use that phrase deliberately. British model Ayesha Tan Jones, 23, was one of these girls. \n‘I was signed up by an agency at the age of 14. I was very, very skinny. By the time I was 17, my body had matured, and I had put on some weight. I was a UK size 8 or 10. \n‘The agency told me to lose four inches in two weeks, and to go back to be weighed and measured when I’d done that. I felt that I wasn’t good enough. I was too scared and embarrassed to go back in. \n‘A few months later, they dropped me. I am sure that my weight played a part in that decision.’ \nAnother model, Rosie Nelson, was told by an agency they wanted her ‘down to the bone’. At 5ft 10in, she weighed 7st 8lb at her skinniest. She now weighs 8st 9lb, which is still technically underweight. \nShe says: ‘I know girls who just eat fruit - three apples a day - or exercise obsessively and cut out dairy, carbohydrates and sugar. \n‘I met a fashion model from London who ate cotton buds and tissue paper to take away her appetite. The use of these tactics peak during the shows, when there is a lot of pressure to be as thin as possible.’ \nRosie now does commercial work, rather than fashion modelling. She says: ‘I’ve realised I can’t do fashion work because I’m not thin enough.’ \nChanel head Karl Lagerfeld called it absurd when a German fashion magazine announced it was going to photograph ‘ordinary, realistic women’ in fashionable clothes recently and said it was driven by overweight women who did not like to be reminded of their weight issues\nIt seems that many other girls have similar experiences to Rosie’s, but won’t come forward for fear of losing out on big jobs. One model told me on the condition of anonymity: ‘Girls are too scared to speak out, but of course no model eats before Fashion Week. \n‘The pressure is immense. We live on cigarettes and coffee, and some girls use drugs or medication to suppress hunger pangs. It’s not healthy, but designers are after only one look - and that’s skin and bone.’ \nAs a woman and mother watching these shows, it’s impossible to apply any sort of aesthetic judgment to the clothes when the girl inside them is clearly unwell and needs help. \nI found myself wondering how any human being, fashion designers included, could believe that an emaciated creature with limbs so skeletal they can barely hold her upright, in any way represents a desirable female form? \nMany believe the fault lies with designers, who create sample sizes for their catwalk shows that are so tiny, only the thinnest models can wear them. And until the British Fashion Council (BFC) cracks down, it will continue. \nLib Dem MP Jo Swinson, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Body Image, is frustrated. \n‘We’ve had some successes, like Debenhams bringing in size 16 mannequins. But it’s not as if there has been a wholesale acceptance by large parts of the industry. \nIt’s no coincidence Vogue boss Anna Wintour and Mrs Beckham have shrunk in the past ten years. Being thin is, first and foremost, a marker of wealth\n‘Some organisations are trying to educate the next generation at fashion colleges, and that could produce lasting change. \n‘But isn’t it terrible that we worked so hard, from the suffragettes on, to get votes and jobs, and now women spend their time worrying about their weight.’ \nSo why, despite growing political pressure, hasn’t the British Fashion Council placed a ban on designers using any girl who falls below a certain weight? \nWhy are agencies, yet again, telling their already slender models that they must be thinner? \nFrance passed a law last year criminalising the use of ‘excessively thin’ models. Unless a model has a doctor’s certificate confirming she is healthy, designers face up to six months in jail and a £54,000 fine. \nBut here, the BFC continues to turn a blind eye to what amounts to the exploitation of young models and the promotion of a message to our daughters which is as unhealthy as smoking or binge-drinking. \nThere are 1.6 million sufferers of eating disorders in this country; 89 per cent of them are women and young girls, with the 14-25 age group worst affected. \nTom Quinn, director of external affairs, at Beat (Beating Eating Disorders), believes the fashion industry is partly to blame. \nTiny, birdlike models with waists as slim as a child’s were seen at Victoria Beckham's show in New York last week \n‘We are concerned about the pressures young females are placed under by the fashion industry,’ he says. ‘Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses, and poor body image and low self-esteem can be a key factor.’ \nHe adds: ‘We may not be able to change an individual’s biological make-up, but we can certainly challenge the toxic cultural ideals forced on our young people.’ \nThis week, our daughters have been watching shows streamed live by the fashion labels they revere, who are openly, arrogantly sabotaging any progress that’s been made. \nI met a fashion model from London who ate cotton buds and tissue paper to take away her appetite. The use of these tactics peak during the shows, when there is a lot of pressure to be as thin as possible I wish the bosses at the BFC could have been in the room when my 13-year-old daughter told me she was worried about her body because she doesn’t have a ‘thigh-gap’ - a space between her upper thighs. \nThen, to illustrate her point, she looked up the latest images from her favourite designers to find that the models don’t just have gaps, they have veritable canyons between their toothpick legs. \n‘See,’ she says, pointing at the photographs, ‘my legs should look like this!’ \nThe Women’s Equality Party is now running a campaign for changes similar to the new French laws, demanding that the model agencies hire only girls who have a minimum body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 (the cut-off point when a woman is considered to be clinically underweight). \n‘We continue to have young models coming to us with terrible eating problems, who have been told by their agencies that they need to get “down to the bone” before they can get a catwalk job,’ says Catherine Riley. \n‘These are girls who already have a BMI of 16 - which is seriously underweight - being told they have to lose even more.’ \nFor the sake of the girls on the catwalks - and the young girls around our kitchen tables - we can only hope this designer dystopia soon comes to an end.",

"title": "McLaurin Confident in Bulldog Defense",
"text": "Collins, Mississippi product Mark McLaurin shares his thoughts on the Mississippi State defense. Steve Robertson 10:58 AM The Mississippi State secondary has been in transition for most of the calendar year. The Bulldogs were already expecting two new starters at cornerback with a pair of seniors moving on to the NFL, but injuries forced some new faces to some new places. Sophomore Mark McLaurin has had to get used to working alongside a collection of moving parts. \nMark McLaurin had to learn to communicate with a pair of new corners in the first half of fall camp, Tolando Cleveland and Cedric Jiles only to see them replaced due to injuries by Lashard Durr and Jamoral Graham. With the promotion of Durr and Graham, sophomore Chris Rayford also moved up into the rotation at corner and fellow safety Jamal Peters joined Coach Terrell Buckley's depth chart outside. \nAgainst LSU, Brandon Bryant went down late in the game, which pushed redshirt freshman Maurice Smitherman into action. To say McLaurin has had to stress the process of communication would be putting it mildly. \n\"It's really just the same no matter who else is out there,\" McLaurin shared. \"Everybody has their own different talents, but we just keep the rotation going. We just have to communicate and be sure that everybody is on the same page once we go on the field.\" \nIn Peter Sirmon's defense, McLaurin has been asked to do a variety of things as well as play with a healthy variety of players. The talented sophomore can be seen playing over the top as a deep safety or lining up near the line of scrimmage to aid in run support or take part in the Bulldog blitz package. \nThe opportunity to be more multiple and line up in different spots adds some spice to the game for McLaurin. \n\"It's good to me, because you just never know what I might have to do in the future.\" McLaurin said. \"I never know what my role may be as my time goes on here at Mississippi State. It's all a learning process and I enjoy it. I enjoy blitzing and I enjoy being able to make more plays and just help the team.\" \nThrough three games this season, McLaurin has had a hand in twelve total tackles including seven solo stops. Throw in a tackle for loss and a pass break-up and McLaurin is certainly earning his scholarship money in the early going. \nThe Mississippi State defense played a strong brand of football in the second half down in Baton Rouge to give the Bulldogs a chance to steal an important SEC road game. While the scoreboard did not prove kind to Coach Dan Mullen's team, McLaurin believes some players grew up during the contest. \n\"We already had a lot of confidence, but we went in at half time and talked about everything,\" McLaurin shared. \"We wanted to come out in the second half and keep fighting. We just wanted to keep going and keep going and we had some things go our way in the second half. We just have to keep fighting for four quarters.\" \nIn the first half, LSU was able to convert some big third downs and keep the Bulldog defense on the field. McLaurin reports that the squad needs to be a little better at getting off of the field if they expect to reach their full potential. \n\"We just have to capitalize in those situations, because we were dominating on first and second down,\" McLaurin shared. \"We just have to keep fighting and stay locked in at all times. You never when a big play is coming, so everybody just has to be expecting it and be ready to bring 11 hats to the ball.\" \nMcLaurin, a south Mississippi native, will venture north to the New England area for the first time in his young life. The experience this weekend is more about winning a football game than marking another state off of the bucket list. While playing in an NFL venue is intriguing, McLaurin reports that the weekend trip to Foxboro is all about business. \n\"It will be a different experience going all the way up there, but playing wise it's really no different,\" McLaurin said. \"We are just looking at this as another Saturday with the lights on. We just have to go up there and play to the best of our abilities. \n\"I am ready to get back on the field and play again. After a loss, we just can't wait to get back out there and play again. We can't let that loss define us. We just have to keep fighting.\" \nUMASS will provide the opposition this week. While the Minutemen are 1-2 on the season, they have played two power five programs tough, Boston College and Florida. Last week the program earned a win over Florida International, so there is some optimism for the home team heading into the weekend. \nMcLaurin reports that Mississippi State is working hard this week to ensure that they are ready for whatever UMASS throws at them this Saturday afternoon. \n\"They are a pretty good team,\" McLaurin said. \"They can throw the ball pretty good and run it pretty good too. We just have to come out and play hard and play hard as a team. We need to figure out how to play a full game of football as a team. We know we have that in us, so we need to find it and hopefully we can do that this weekend.\" \nThe Bulldogs (1-2) will look to even their record this weekend against their second non-conference opponent of the 2016 season. Mississippi State is favored by over three touchdowns, but will certainly not take anything for granted as they tee it up at Gillette Stadium this Saturday. Share on Facebook",

"text": "Ben Frost - \"Theory of Machines\" The Edgy Comedian \nWhat's that smell? It's the harsh odor of a brand new style of white-guy parody rap—think Weird Al meets Lonely Island, seasoned with more than a hint of clenched-fist Gamergate rage. Lil Dicky and his rabid fandom paved the way, and a fleet of 4Chan-fluent young edgelords are rising in his wake. Benjamin Franklin's advice—\"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\"—is the best defense here. For example, a trained eye can tell a lot about the kind of individual who would choose \"Dicks Out For Harambe\"—a trop-pop tune by 18-year-old newcomer Rockie Gold that's currently perched on top of Spotify's Viral 50 chart—as his Anthem. \nWill this guy have a playful sense of humor? Probably not in the way you might hope: the song's lyrics carry murky political undertones, including references to controversial alt-right figures like Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos . The dude bumping this Anthem is an unemployed basement-dweller with a parentally-funded Steam account who's going to spend the date alternating between Red Pill-sourced negging tactics and muttering in your ear about Zionists, Lena Dunham, the Bilderberg Group, and Hillary Clinton's health. Don't expect great sex—he's a virgin. \nKey Anthems: \nRockie Gold - \"Dicks Out For Harambe\" The Globetrotting Oasis Finder \nThe world is a fragrant mystery for The Globetrotting Oasis Finder. Dressed in loose cloth pants and a quilted vest, this dude gravitates to house music overflowing with hand-drums, sitar, thumping Playa-ready bass lines and vaguely foreign vocal samples. He's a coder at a food-delivery start-up who casually drops words like \"Marrakech,\" \"caravan\" and \"polyamorous.\" Pack your toothbrush for this date, because you'll certainly be swept away on a whirlwind adventure by an enigmatic stranger consumed with wanderlust—or, at the very least, with a groovy tapestry in his apartment. \nKey Anthems: \nOceanvs Orientalis - \"Asfour\" The Coldplay (Tech House Remix) Fitness Warrior \nThis 34-year-old dude's profile features pictures of him on top of a mountain or surrounded by African kids, as well as a list of the cities where he's lived (which inevitably includes \"Philly\"). This guy is by no means an electronic music expert; rather, he needs some extra juice for his Crossfit class, and pulsing Coldplay remixes from the biggest names on Beatport offer just the ticket. His whole lifestyle is about results—he works in finance, drives an Audi, chugs fish oil, employs the #gymflow hashtag, knows his own blood type, and \"isn't just there for the hookup.\" In fact, he desperately wants to get married. He may be Marco Rubio in disguise. Not for the faint of heart. \nKey Anthems:",

"text": "e-mail 7\nView \ncomments\nWith a presence in Hollywood that spans more than five decades, you'd think Kurt Russell is a master of show biz politics - but he isn't, by his own admission. \n'Did I play the game correctly? You bet I didn’t! I did not,' the Hollywood veteran, 65, said in October's GQ . 'I didn’t go to the events. I didn’t say the right things to the right people. \n'I said the wrong things to the right people.' \nScroll down for video \nDapper in denim: October's edition of GQ features an insightful interview with Kurt Russell, 65, in which the veteran actor addresses his career controversies and much more\nElder statesman: Russell, in the chat, speaks about his five decades-plus in show business. Here, the actor appeared at the New Orleans premiere of his new film Deepwater Horizon on Monday\nEnsemble: Kurt (third from left) is flanked by his Deepwater Horizon colleagues at the premiere including (L to R): director Peter Berg, Gina Rodriguez, Kate Hudson, Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Mark Wahlberg\nOne possible indicator of such could come with Kurt's awards - or lack thereof, as he's only been nominated once apiece for an Emmy (for 1979's Elvis) and Golden Globe (1984's Silkwood), losing on both occasions. \n'There are some specific reasons for that under-appreciation thing and I’m responsible for them,' the Tombstone star told the magazine. \nIn the chat, the Backdraft star also addressed what he believes is a commonly held misconception in show business circle: That he doesn't care about his work. \nFab four: Deepwater Hoirizon, which centers around the 2010 Gulf Coast spill, received a standing ovation from audiences at the recent Toronto Film Festival\n'I've had to suffer that one - that apparently 'he just doesn't care,\"' the actor said. 'No, no, no, no, no. Anybody that's ever worked with me will tell you: On the set, Kurt, he's there and he's ready to go and he questions and he pushes hard. He's there. \n'But when the man says, \"That's a wrap,' I'm bolting. As soon as that day's done, as soon as that clapper bangs, I'm out. \"Goodnight guys, see you tomorrow - I'm going into my life now.\"' \nDespite the lack of trophies on his mantle, the 3000 Miles to Graceland actor said he's proud of his body of work - for the most part. \nMeaty role: Kurt plays Jimmy 'Mr. Jimmy' Harrell in the biographical movie about the Gulf of Mexico oil spill \n'Most of the movies I’ve done, people have had a good time with,' he said. 'Some of them I’ve done they’ve had a great time with.' \n'And then some of those movies that I’ve done are not just going to stand up, they fall into the category of: Yeah, a hundred years from now, there will be some moviegoers that will look back and say, ‘Well, look at that guy… I mean, that was a hundred years ago, but he knew what f*",

"title": "Camera tests: iPhone 7 Plus Portrait mode vs DSLR",
"text": "\nHow does the iPhone 7 Plus's upcoming Portrait mode fare against a Canon DSLR? It's not a fair fight, but it's getting closer.\nWhen the iPhone 7 Plus and its dual-camera system launched last Friday, it did so missing a key feature: Portrait mode, which Apple promised would arrive later this Fall. Portrait mode uses the Plus's two cameras to create a faux depth-of-field effect with a gaussian blur, simulating the look of higher-end cameras like DSLRs and mirrorless models.\nOn stage, Apple SVP of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller even jokingly compared the iPhone's photos to a \"DSLR photo\" — before revealing the image had, in fact, been taken with an iPhone 7 Plus and a beta of Portrait mode.\nWith Portrait mode coming to public beta users with iOS 10.1 this Friday, we figured a perfect early test of this mode was to actually compare it to an entry-level DSLR — namely, Canon's T4i — with a 40mm f/2.8 lens, just a little bit shallower than the iPhone 7 Plus's second 56mm-equivalent lens.\nThis feature is still quite clearly a beta, so I wasn't expecting miracles or for the iPhone 7 Plus to \"beat\" the Canon (spoiler: it doesn't). But what I do find fascinating is just how close the iPhone comes in certain circumstances to replicating — or, in some case, exceeding — the DSLR look without the heft or the cost of a pro camera setup.\nApple occasionally offers updates to iOS 10 , watchOS 3 , tvOS 10 , and macOS Sierra as closed developer previews or public betas for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. (Sadly, no public betas for the Apple Watch or tvOS.) While the betas contain new features, they also contain pre-release bugs that can prevent the normal use of your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, or Mac, and are not intended for everyday use on a primary device. That's why we strongly recommend staying away from developer previews unless you need them for software development, and using the public betas with caution. If you depend on your devices, wait for the final release.\n\n\nHow we tested Like my other camera tests, the goal for these was to simulate the way an average user might snap images with their iPhone or entry-level DSLR. Both cameras were shot freehand, and though I shot with the DSLR in Manual mode, that was primarily to get a similar ISO and shutter speed to the iPhone's telephoto lens, and I kept the Canon's white balance on auto. Both recorded to JPEG, with no post-processing.\nFor the DSLR comparison, I used my Canon Rebel T4i with Canon's 40mm f/2.8 pancake lens to match the iPhone 7 Plus's telephoto lens setup as much as possible.\nNOTE: Though many (myself included) have argued that this system is closer in comparison to a normal or portrait lens than a true telephoto, I understand Apple's intentions here: Because they're marketing the lens in conjunction with a 2x feature, it may seem more appropriate to call it \"tele\" than \"normal\" or \"portrait\" to the average user — especially considering that Apple has a planned \"Portrait\" feature coming out that utilizes both lenses later this year. For that reason, I'm referring to the lens as Apple names it — tele, or telephoto — even though I don't necessarily agree with that branding.\nPeople The iPhone 7 Plus's Portrait mode is designed around taking snapshots of people — it has face and body detection built in to aid with the effect — so it's only fair that its first test actually involve human subjects.\nWhen it comes to shooting outdoors, the two cameras have almost identical picture quality, and the trees are nicely blurred out in the background. Portrait mode seems to struggle a bit right now with getting smooth cuts for faces and bodies against highly blurred backgrounds, however; it's most obvious against my hair in the first shot, and my male subject's face and body when shooting backlit.\nThe iPhone tends to try and grab more information about the background than the Canon, and as such, the background is a lot darker and has more definition in the trees than the DSLR shots, which blow out the light between the trees for a more stylized effect. (Don't make me call it bokeh.)\nIndoors, the Canon's superior sensor offers a lot more detail than the iPhone, which resorts to smoothing pixels a bit to keep the image clear. The depth of field effect is gorgeous on the smartphone, however, providing a nice mid-level blur as well as blurring out the Enceladus poster in the background.\nPets I tricked a few people on Twitter with the photos below, and for good reason: The iPhone loves outdoor subjects with clear focal areas to measure.\nThough the iPhone continues to process images with a slightly warmer coloration and sharpness than the Canon, the depth maps on these images are quite similar. The Canon benefits from some foreground blur, but the iPhone smartly uses the dog's feet in this photo to create a midpoint blur and taper between that and the full background blur, and it looks beautiful. Even with the dog in motion, the iPhone identifies differing blur points and tapers down, though it's not as smooth as the Canon.\nI wasn't supposed to be able to get this photo: When I first tried to grab it, Portrait mode insisted I was too close to my subject, and I probably was — I only managed to snap this after moving away, then pushing back in. But boy, am I glad I did. Even in relatively low-light conditions, I got a lot of the detail in our dog's face, and the multi-layered blur separates her paws and ears from the rest of the scene.\nProducts I take a lot (a lot) of technology product shots, largely with my DSLR; in the past, the iPhone's lack of depth (save for macro modes) has made it difficult to get good spotlight shots. But I've been toying with shooting iMore heroes on the iPhone 7 Plus, and Portrait mode makes it surprisingly easy — as long as there's good light.\nThough I can't get quite as close as I'd like to when shooting in Portrait mode with the iPhone 7 (the 56mm-equivalent lens has a minimum focus distance of 19 inches), it still nicely highlights the iPhone and blurs out the background, though not with as much light diffusion as the Canon.\nWhere the iPhone unfortunately falls flat is low-light snaps: Because the iPhone 7 Plus's 56mm-equivalent lens has no optical image stabilization and a smaller sensor, it has real trouble capturing low-light images — especially low-light images that are close up. I went back and forth between the \"not enough light\" and \"back up\" error messages for at least two minutes before eventually deciding to just take the snap as-is, without the Portrait mode. It still has some depth of focus to it, but the image isn't nearly as clear or as tapered as the Canon.\nThis poor Lego.\nI really pushed Portrait mode to the limit here, giving it a tiny subject to work with against a grained background, all while trying to shoot as close as humanly possible. The result: A very grainy photo on the iPhone 7 Plus side without a ton of nuance to the background blur, and a closer shot that confused the head of the Stormtrooper for the background. Whoops.\nFlowers Like the Lego example above, flowers are entirely outside Portrait mode's current scope, and given how well you can get decent depth of field shooting macro with the wide-angle, I don't know if I'd use Portrait for this stuff very often.\nThe flowers and leaves are a bit more blown out than the Canon image, in part due to this snap being in the shade and close to evening time. While there's a nice variegated blur going on at the top of the image with the ferns, the middle of the image (between the flowers) didn't get a blur applied at all, and the wall looks strangely in focus.\nWere I going to shoot nature closeups with this mode, I'd probably do something closer to this shot: Macro leaves with the rest of the background out of focus. The only real clue between these two shots, besides the color temperature, is the slight foreground blur on the Canon image.\nDrinks Taking artsy drink shots is a time-honored Instagram tradition, but I'm skeptical as to how well the iPhone's telephoto lens will snap them unless you're outdoors or in a brightly lit area.\nAdmittedly, I gave the iPhone a stiff challenge in this photo of a whiskey bottle: glass bottle, dark kitchen, mirrored surface, onion in the background. And while it didn't exactly fail this challenge, there's no question about which image looks better. The iPhone struggled with blur areas, getting a nice foreground blur but missing parts of the reflective table and accidentally blurring out words on the bottle. And when it comes to macro, of course, the telephoto can't focus on the bottle at all, ceding the competition to the Canon.\nBottom line Portrait is getting its start in beta as a fun experiment and a bit of a gimmick — one I have no doubt will take over Instagram as readily as vignetting and tilt-shift did. But I have high hopes for the feature: The iPhone is always going to struggle against something as full-featured as a DSLR given its limited room for sensors and lenses, but the device still puts together an awfully strong showing — and does so without the need of carrying a pro camera setup or fiddling with manual controls.\nIn some cases during our tests, I was able to get a very similar shot to my DSLR without taking the time to check the exposure meter and adjust my shutter speed accordingly; I needed only to lift the iPhone up to my subject and snap the photo.\nThe iPhone's Image Signal Processor is working overtime when you snap these shots, which is why you won't see extra bells and whistles just yet — no Flash or low-light images, no zoom, and no official support for snapping photos of objects. But I have no doubt this feature will evolve and transform as more users get their hands on the Public Beta and Apple continues to refine its controls.\nFor now, it's a fascinatingly fun feature to play with, and I can't wait to give it a more thorough run through its paces over the next few days.\nDo you have an iPhone 7 Plus and plan to dive in to the Public Beta to test out Portrait mode this Friday? Let us know what you think.\niPhone photography \nCamera tests: Zoom on the iPhone 7 vs iPhone 7 Plus Why the iPhone 7 Plus telephoto won't shoot in low-light situations Ten tips for taking great iPhone photos Camera app: The ultimate guide Photos: The ultimate guide Best manual camera apps that shoot RAW for iPhone \n",

"text": "Durante los últimos 15 años, Perú, Brasil, Colombia y Chile lograron duplicar o triplicar la cantidad de pasajeros en vuelos de cabotaje. En la Argentina, en cambio, la mejora fue solo del 21%. Eso motivó al Gobierno a proponerse duplicar los viajantes actuales: que pasen de 10 millones actuales a 20 millones. Para lograrlo, promete una inversión que superará los $ 22.000 millones hasta 2019.\nEl ministerio de Transporte detectó graves problemas en los aeropuertos. Aunque algunas fachadas estaban bien, lo que no se ve estaba en condiciones defectuosas. La torre de control en Iguazú está disminuída y la pista de Comodoro Rivadavia está rota. “El aeropuerto de Jujuy tiene 40 años de antigüedad y el de Viedma también es bien viejito”, pintó el ministro Guillermo Dietrich, a cargo de la cartera.\nIntercargo, la proveedora de las líneas aéreas, es “improductiva y costosa”. La misión del Gobierno es mejorarla. “Nos encontramos con graves problemas estructurales y de mantenimiento”, señaló Patricio Di Stefano, presidente del Organismo Regulador del Sistema Nacional de Aeropuertos (ORSNA). “Más del 50% de las torres de control son antigüas”, remarcó.\nCon el dinero que cobran por las tasas, el Gobierno lanzará un plan de obras de mejoras edilicias en Ezeiza, Aeroparque, Trelew, Iguazú, Mendoza, Salta, Tucumán, Comodoro Rivadavia, San Juan. Durante un encuentro con la prensa, exhibieron algunas fotografías de esas instalaciones y son muy precarias.\nLa inversión se hará con los fondos que recauda el Estado a través de las tasas aeroportuarias. El kirchnerismo juntó $ 2.700 millones en los últimos 6 años, pero no los utilizó. “Las tasas aumentaban al 10%, pero la inflación era del 30%”, precisó Dietrich. “La plata se fue devaluando”, radiografió Di Stéfano. “Hubo mala administración de recursos y desidia”, aseguraron.\nEl plan de obras comprende $ 18.709 millones en la mejora de 19 aeropuertos. La infraestructura para la navegación aérea (como torres) será dotada de $ 2.340 millones, mientras que la aviación Civil (como el aeropuerto de Morón) recibirá $ 1.700 millones.\n“No hay cielos abiertos. Nunca los hubo y nunca habrá”, definió Dietrich a la política aerocomercial, alejándose de toda polémica al respecto. El foco está en cabotaje, porque Argentina tiene un alto nivel de vuelos internacionales por pasajero.",

Her idealism is broken hard by the abuse she suffers in Briarcliff, but she ultimately comes out on top through sheer determination. FX \nEvan Peters as Tate Langdon, \"Murder House\" -- Peters is arguably the most popular \"AHS\" cast member, if the Twitter rage over his absence in the \"Roanoke\" premiere is any indication. We attribute this to his strong performance as the clingy teen killer Tate, who is proof that you should always be skeptical of the \"Nice Guys.\" FX \nTaissa Farmiga as Violet Harmon, \"Murder House\" -- Of course, if we include Tate on our All-Star roster, we also have to include the object of his obsession. Taissa Farmiga got one of the best scenes in \"Murder House\" when she discovered that she was dead after attempting to run out of her house... only to find herself back inside. FX \nLily Rabe as Sister Mary Eunice, \"Asylum\" -- Sister Mary's heel turn is one of the best twists in \"AHS\" history. After being possessed by the devil, she's transformed from a demure, devout young nun to a sexually charged manipulator. And don't even get us started on her horrible demise. FX \nAngela Bassett as Marie Laveau, \"Coven\" -- The Voodoo Queen of New Orleans' bitter feud with Fiona and Madame LaLaurie was one of the highlights of \"Coven,\" as it allowed for some great dialogue for three of the best actresses in the \"AHS\" stable. The fact that Laveau was an actual 19th-century priestess adds to her intrigue, even if she's been heavily fictionalized for TV. FX \nFrances Conroy as Myrtle Snow, \"Coven\" -- Like Laveau, Myrtle was another foe for Fiona to square off against. Eccentric, biting, and devoted to the Academy, she proved to be both a mother figure and one of the most violent characters in season 3. Just ask the Council members who condemned her to death. FX \nZachary Quinto as Dr. Thredson, \"Asylum\" -- Move over, Sylar. Thredson is now the creepiest character Quinto has ever played on TV. His compassionate exterior was merely a front that allowed him to manipulate Lana and Kit and to hide his bloodlust. It's that constant, cruel subversion that makes \"Asylum\" such a perversely compelling piece of TV. FX \nDenis O'Hare as Liz Taylor, \"Hotel\" -- Season 5 of \"AHS\" does not have the adoration enjoyed by its peers, but O'Hare is one of its few bright spots. His Liz Taylor commands everyone's attention with her confidence and acidity, but it's her vulnerability and transition into life as a woman that makes her unforgettable. \nEmma Roberts as Madison Montgomery, \"Coven\" -- Madison was the fun-to-hate member of Miss Robichaux's Academy. A mean girl with telekinesis, she was once described by Queenie as a \"stone cold bitch who loves hard drinking, big d---s and trouble.\" She also gets revenge on a fraternity that gang-rapes her by flipping over their party bus. FX \nNaomi Grossman as Pepper, \"Asylum\"/\"Freak Show\" -- You can't have an all-star cast without Pepper, a character so popular that she broke Ryan Murphy 's promise that each \"AHS\" season would be completely detached from each other. Her fun spirit and tragic arc made her a fan favorite, as did her transformation into a genius in \"Asylum.\" FX \nFinn Wittrock as Dandy Mott, \"Freak Show\" -- As Angela Bassett 's character said just before killing him, Dandy Mott was the biggest freak on \"Freak Show.\" A vain, spoiled brat who first wants to belong with the freaks and later wants to kill them. FX \nWes Bentley as Edward Mordrake, \"Freak Show\" -- Twisty and Pepper got everyone's attention on \"Freak Show,\" but Bentley's portrayal of a gentleman cursed to be the Grim Reaper by his second face deserves praise. He is simultaneously dignified and chilling, and we could gaze at those wild muttonchops for days. FX \nGabourey Sidibe as Queenie, \"Coven\"/\"Hotel\" -- When you try to make a centuries-old witch drop her racist mentality by forcing her to watch \"Roots,\" you're definitely going to make this list. Queenie's return in \"Hotel\" got fans excited, but that joy turned to rage when she got killed off in a moment that will live in \"AHS\" infamy. FX \nKathy Bates as Madame Delphine LaLaurie, \"Coven\" -- Speaking of the centuries-old racist witch, here she is now. Bates' first \"AHS\" role was a fictionalized version of an actual slave torturer from the 19th century. Imagine her surprise when she finds out who Barack Obama is. FX \nJamie Brewer as Adelaide Langdon, \"Murder House\" -- Addie is among the first of many, many people who warn the Harmons to get out of the house to no avail. She became a dark horse favorite for early adopters of the show as her gentle nature contrasted with her twisted mother and brother. She also was notable for being a character with Down syndrome played by an actress who also had the genetic disorder. FX \nJohn Carroll Lynch as Twisty, \"Freak Show\" -- \"AHS\" has had many freaky monsters and killers like Rubber Man and Bloody Face, but it's Twisty that has become the series' most iconic image. His introduction in broad daylight is an unnerving, masterful scene thanks in large part to Lynch's ability to creep people out with just his eyes and physicality. FX \nJessica Lange as Constance Langdon, \"Murder House\" -- Finally, we have the \"AHS\" queen. It is incredibly hard to pick which of Lange's four \"AHS\" roles was best. We almost went with Fiona Goode, but ultimately settled on Constance. It was this performance that set the standard for all future \"AHS\" divas and helped make Ryan Murphy 's series appointment television for lovers of camp. \nFrom Evan Peters‘ Tate to Sarah Paulson‘s Lana Winters, we pick the dream lineup across six seasons of the nightmarish show 1 of 19 \nLong-running reality shows often have \"all-star\" seasons featuring a menagerie of past contestants coming back for another go. That got us to thinking: \"American Horror Story\" is expected to start connecting its seasons together this year, so why not create a dream cast of the best characters from the nightmarish show?",

"text": "e-mail 7\nView \ncomments\nIn the spring she rekindled her relationship with Made In Chelsea beau Hugo Taylor.\nAnd that may be one reason why reality star Millie Mackintosh looked so content and radiant as she attended the relaunch party of celebrity hotspot Bluebird in London on Wednesday. \nProving that demure clothing can still pop, the 26-year-old wore an animal print dress that fell well below her knees, but still teased her petite frame. \nStunning: Made In Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh looked radiant as she attended the relaunch party of celebrity hotspot Bluebird in London on Wednesday evening\nThe black-and-white frock featured mesh illusion cutouts near her shoulders and another just north of the hemline. \nMillie continued the theme of black with her elegant, peep-toe heels, which showed off her perfectly pedicured toes. \nShe carried her essentials in a small black handbag, which she dangled from her right shoulder throughout the evening. \nShe gets it: Proving that demure clothing can still pop, the 26-year-old wore an animal print dress that fell well below her knees, but still teased her petite frame\nLeggy ladies: Millie attended the event with her friend Lily Frieda, who looked ravishing in a knee-length blue dress\nWhile the budding designer always look fresh-faced and rested, she seemed extra glam at the party, perhaps owing to a bizarre new fitness craze she tested at Harvey Nichols on Tuesday. \nMillie stepped into 111CRYO, the first electric-powered, whole body cryotherapy chamber in the UK to 'harness the power of cold' for their health and beauty.\nShe uploaded a photo of herself to Instagram which shows her standing outside of the chamber in a bathing suit and resting her arms on her shoulders to keep warm, along with the caption: 'Feeling pretty good after 3 minutes in a -90 chamber @111cryo dancing to Beyoncé.' \nDoes a body good?

"text": "Investors can approach the Federal Reserve 's decision not to raise rates in two ways: jump up and down with glee and start talking about December rate hikes, or go on with life and buy stocks that show growth. Jim Cramer is taking the second approach. \n\"How come I'm not upset about the Fed's decision to do nothing? Because, like Janet Yellen , I see little inflation and low growth on the horizon, which means raising rates would be a really dumb idea,\" the \" Mad Money \" host said. \nThe Fed impressed Cramer, as it proved it was not on autopilot, raising rate because it said it might do so. Yellen's commentary was also in sync with what Cramer heard from several CEOs who are trying to figure out how August turned out to be a weak month.\n\n\n\n\nGetty Images The US Capitol building After all, it is tough to raise rates when things just turned downward, and no one knows why. Only ideologues want action now, Cramer said. \n\"Unlike the constant gripers, I salute them,\" Cramer said. \nThe Fed's decision traced out a long-term vision for meager growth. Thus, Cramer hunted for companies with above-average growth, with stocks that do not adequately reflect the strength of their numbers. \nThis might seem like finding a needle in a haystack, but Cramer was up to the challenge. \n\"You follow enough companies, you feel around the haystack, and you discover it's filled with needles,\" Cramer said. \nHe spotted KB Home , Adobe and FedEx . All three are in different industries and have prospered in a slow-growth environment. They were all \"gettable.\" \nKB Home has done well because it owns land in the growth state of Canada. FedEx benefits as the delivery service for the internet, and Adobe has products in the heart of the fast-growing cloud computing and internet of things segments. \n\"Take your pick. Believe me, it's a lot more lucrative than moaning and groaning about the Fed,\" Cramer said. \n\nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC \nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

"title": "El artista Ai Weiwei trabaja sobre los refugiados y noquea",
"text": "Estaban tan contentos los Strozzi -una de las familias más ricas de Florencia durante el Renacimiento italiano- con el palazzo aun más grande que el de los Medici que habían levantado a fines del siglo XV en medio de la ciudad, que le agregaron el escudo heráldico de la familia sobre el arco de las ventanas superiores. Pero desde hoy y hasta el 22 de enero del año que viene, la insignia de los Strozzi dormirá debajo de los gomones rojos que Ai Weiwei, el artista contemporáneo más impertinente del momento, montó sobre los ventanales de dos de las fachadas del emblemático edificio florentino.\nLa instalación, que alude a la fragilidad con la que miles de refugiados cruzan el océano huyendo del horror, da la bienvenida a la muestra \"Libero\" (Libre), la primera gran exhibición del disidente chino en Italia.\n“Yo mismo he sido un prófugo del desierto de Gobi. Soy muy sensible a la situación de quien debe dejar su lugar y emigrar. Hice esta instalación sobre todo en Florencia, que es la ciudad del Renacimiento. He querido hacer una declaración artística que convirtiera a Florencia el centro del arte contemporáneo”, dice Weiwei durante la conferencia de prensa en el Palazzo Strozzi en la que presenta la muestra que revisita su obra durante las últimas tres décadas.\nSin embargo aquí sus gomones sobre el Palazzo Strozzi irritaron a buena parte de la sociedad local. Pero Weiwei ya está curtido si de irritar humores se trata: no cómodo con su arte transgresor, capaz de tatuar Coca Cola sobre jarrones de la dinastía Han o intervenir urnas funerarias del neolítico chorreándolas con pintura para autos , se convirtió en blanco del gobierno chino que lo acusó de evasión fiscal, lo encarceló y durante cinco años le retuvo el pasaporte. Se volvió así un ícono de la libertad de expresión y defensa de los derechos humanos. Recién pudo salir de China en 2015 y, desde hace unos meses, se instaló en Berlín.\n“El arte contemporáneo, para mí, es una cuestión de crear conciencia y despertar debate”, dice Weiwei. De a ratos, mientras habla, alza su celular y fotografía a los periodistas. “Tengo un gran respeto por quienes buscan la libertad, sacrificándose, asumiendo riesgos para ellos y para sus hijos. Los refugiados son los héroes de nuestro tiempo . Mi trabajo muestra mi respeto por ellos. Son mis hermanos”, dice.\nLa muestra incluye obras de denuncia como Snake Bag (Cartera serpiente), realizada con las mochilas de los miles de estudiantes muertos en el terremoto de Sichuan de 2008, cuando las escuelas precarias levantadas por el gobierno colapsaron, hasta la instalación de 950 bicicletas marca Forever, típica de los años ’50, con la que Weiwei burla el problema del transporte en China.\nEl artista dedicó una sala a la cultura italiana. Ayudado por estudiantes de la Academia de Bellas Artes de Florencia, montó retratos de Dante, Galileo, Girolamo Savonarola y del mismísimo Filippo Strozzi en piezas de Lego.\n“Solía considerarme moderno y hasta pensaba en cortar mis raíces pero, conforme pasa el tiempo, estoy por cumplir 60 años, comencé a prestarle mucha atención a la tradición y a ahondar en la gente de otros tiempos, qué material usaban, qué lengua hablaban, cómo se relacionaban consigo mismos o con la naturaleza -dice Weiwei, intenso usuario de twitter e instagram-.\n\" La tecnología, sin embargo, nos libera del pasado y, desde mi punto de vista, vivimos un tiempo muy interesante para el desarrollo humano de esta tecnología. La tecnología es democrática y no tiene límites. Esta es una condición muy impensada.” ¿Y por qué la muestra se llama 'Libero'? “El ser libre simplemente no existe. Implica esfuerzo, librar alguna batalla. 'Libero' alude a una condición que tiene que ver con que nos tenemos que involucrar y luchar”, explica Weiwei.\nLa historiadora del arte y ex funcionaria del polo museal de Florencia Cristina Acidini esboza una definición del arte del chino: “Su producción entra en el ámbito de imágenes significativas y memorables, algo típico del arte conceptual que no tiene que ver necesariamente con las categorías estéticas de otros tiempos. Es una expresividad, una creatividad que trae una idea visual que antes no existía, a veces a través del uso de objetos preexistentes”.\nY defiende la instalación de los gomones que Weiwei bautizó Reframe (Redefinición): “Estos gomones son más expresivos y apelan más a la sensibilidad que cualquier imagen que podamos ver en el noticiero. Nos acerca el aspecto físico tangible, la dimensión tridimensional de estos acontecimientos”, dice Acidini.\nLos gomones rojos a los que trepan los refugiados desesperados que cubren los ventanales del Palazo Strozzi se reflejan en las vidrieras del local de enfrente, la exclusiva tienda Louis Vuitton, donde una cartera amarilla cuesta 2.700 euros y una chaqueta 3.500. El contraste noquea. Imposible pasar por aquí y salir indemne.",

"text": "Beve liquido per wc: bimba gravissima Beve liquido per wc: bimba gravissima Soccorsa a Modena, poi ricovero in Rianimazione pediatrica a Bologna in condizioni critiche. La polizia analizza il flacone di Carlo Gregori 21 settembre 2016 \nAnche se non corre pericolo di vita, sono molto gravi le condizioni di una bimba di un anno che ha bevuto liquido per la pulizia del wc trovato nella casa dove vive con i genitori, una coppia tunisina che abita a Modena. La piccola è ricoverata in Rianimazione pediatrica al Sant’Orsola di Bologna: per due o tre giorni i medici non scioglieranno la prognosi: c’è ancora il rischio che la sostanza che ha ingerito possa perforare lo stomaco o l'intestino. \nAl Sant’Orsola la neonata, che ha 13 mesi, è arrivata sabato dal Policlinico di Modena, dove i genitori l’avevano portata il giorno precedente, subito dopo l'incidente in casa. \nAvevano portato anche la bottiglia dalla quale la figlia aveva bevuto: un contenitore anonimo nel quale la madre, a quanto si apprende, aveva diluito con acqua un liquido per la pulizia del water acquistato in Tunisia. Circostanza che ha reso particolarmente difficile individuare il tipo di sostanza tossica ingerito: un mistero risolto dalla Polizia Scientifica di Bologna. Sul caso la Procura di Modena ora sta svolgendo accertamenti: per adesso non sono state mosse ipotesi di accusa verso i genitori. \nIl caso ha raggiunto il suo punto critico venerdì quando i genitori hanno portato la piccola al pronto soccorso pediatrico. Hanno spiegato ai medici che vomitava spesso e stava male. Il personale del pronto soccorso l’ha stabilizzata con i rianimatori. Le sue condizioni erano gravi. Data la delicatezza del caso si è deciso di portare la bimba a Bologna: al Sant’Orsola è infatti attiva una unità di terapia intensiva pediatrica specializzata anche in questi interventi. \nSabato l’ambulanza ha portato la bambina al policlinico di Bologna dove è stata subito intubata e sottoposta a terapie particolari. Non era chiaro quale liquido avesse ingerito: la madre non era in grado di dire cosa contenesse il falcone del liquido per la pulizia dei wc comperato in Tunisia. Non solo: si è purtroppo scoperto che il policlinico di Bologna non ha una convenzione con l’Università per far sottoporre ad analisi chimica il liquido corrosivo e quindi arrivare a identificarlo con esattezza. Per questo motivo, la sostanza ingerita è rimasta per ore un mistero. I medici hanno potuto solo intuirla affrontando il caso con una terapia mirata ma ovviamente in parte ipotetica. Per fortuna la Questura di Bologna ha preso in mano la questione del liquido ingerito. Con un’auto di pattuglia ha fatto consegnare il flacone alla Scientifica che ha svolto analisi e nell’arco di poche ore si è chiarito di che sostanza si trattava. Subito è partita una telefonata per il policlinico bolognese e i medici hanno così potuto affrontare più serenamente la cura della bambina. \nLa terapia è stata impostata principalmente in difesa delle vie aeree superiori permettendo così una corretta respirazione al corpicino.\nSulla prognosi della bambina, nessuno può per ora sbilanciarsi: i medici ritengono che sia fuori pericolo ma solo venerdì o sabato potranno escludere eventuali complicanze. Intanto il caso è al vaglio del pm modenese Katia Marino. 21 settembre 2016",

"text": "GUEST: \nTechnology can change an industry.\nIn the ’90s, email completely revolutionized the way customers interact with companies, and live chat made these interactions even more instantaneous. So what will be the next technology trend to come along and change the way businesses communicate with each other?\nSome professionals in the B2B (business-to-business) customer support industry are speculating that chatbots , a way of receiving automated responses based on the user-submitted text in chat, will be the next major evolution in customer communication. But are they right? Let’s take a look at how chatbots currently mesh with B2B customer support and if they truly have the potential to alter the lines of communication in the future. In particular, there are three key metrics that should be evaluated.\n1. Accuracy One of the areas B2B customer support differs from B2C is related to more importance being placed on resolving issues correctly in B2B support. Losing an account for a B2C company may put a small dent in revenue, but losing a B2B account, especially if it’s sizable, could put an entire company at risk financially.\nWith accuracy being paramount, even the most sophisticated machine learning produces only an 85 percent accuracy rate for chatbot responses, and it’s safe to say many enterprise solutions perform well below this percentage. Especially in B2B, in order for chatbots (or any customer support medium) to be effective, the user needs to receive the correct information to resolve their issue.\nIf they can’t get the answer they need, then it’s a waste of the user’s time, and their frustration only increases. As an employer of B2B support agents myself, if an agent was wrong with their response 15 percent of the time, they probably wouldn’t have a job for very long. Solving customer issues correctly the first time is simply crucial to happy customers and a productive support team.\n2. Integration Speak with any technology professional in B2B or B2C and they’ll stress the importance of integrations and systems communicating together. With so many software solutions specialized in certain tasks and procedures, limiting the amount of manual work through integrations is crucial to reducing overhead costs.\nAs it stands today, the majority of chatbots currently on the market exist completely independently of customer support software. Sure, there are some integrations available, but these can sometimes be cumbersome and may actually result in more work for agents.\nFor example, a chatbot solution may not filter out bot responses, meaning an agent may have to sift through a long chatbot conversation in order to get up to speed with a customer issue. This can be problematic if supporting a customer via phone or live chat, where responses are expected to be more immediate than email. It also hurts how quickly agents can address issues as well as their overall productivity.\n3. User experience For better or worse, the B2B industry does not adopt technology as fast as its B2C counterpart. Some employees in the B2B industry still prefer to pick up the phone and will reach out to any contact they have within a company — be it sales, IT, or support — with any issue they may have because they either have a working relationship with that person or they don’t want to have to find the right contact themselves.\nWith this said, the current user experience for chatbots can be confusing for B2B customers. Believe it or not, some confusion still exists in non-tech industries between live chat and chatbots, where a customer thinks they are starting a chat conversation with a person and gets confused when bot responses are presented instead.\nThe undoubted unpleasantness of this experience may diminish over time as chatbots become more high profile, but a user experience solution I’d like to see implemented more for B2B is unifying both live chat and chatbots into a single experience. By this, I’m talking about when a chat window is initially opened, a customer has a choice on what path they’d like to pursue (live chat or chatbot) to resolve their issue.\nWhat comes next In conclusion, chatbots currently do not mesh well with B2B customer support and fare little better with B2C customer support. Chatbots just aren’t accurate enough currently to replace the personal touch needed to maintain the delicate, complex, and highly important relationships with B2B customers.\nThe sophistication of integrations supplied by chatbot systems with other software is still emerging, and overall education about the functionality of chatbots needs to increase for the B2B audience to feel more comfortable using them. Most of the functionality of chatbots today can be better optimized through the right customer support software solution that enables tickets to be specifically routed to the correct agent or team.\nEven though chatbots aren’t quite ready to take over the world, the technology is certainly intriguing, and the customer support industry should definitely keep an eye on it. It wasn’t very long ago people were questioning the impact of email in the same way we’re discussing chatbots today. Although it seems unlikely chatbots will have the same impact on everyday life as email has, the possibility of refining and deploying automated assistance for daily use in business may only be a decade or two away. To echo my initial statement, technology can change an industry, and this type of technology is capable of wide-scale change. It’s just not there yet, especially in the business-to-business world.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

Sign up for free newsletters to get more of the AJC delivered to your inbox. \nEveryone has a story to tell about Aidan Heath’s hugs, spunky nature and kind heart. \nOn the “Prayers for Aidan” Facebook page , parents who share in mother Ashley Heath’s grief and strangers who can’t imagine what it feels like to lose a child flooded the online memorial with prayers and encouraging words. \nThe 7-year-old died Saturday after being in the hospital a little more than a week, according to a post on the Facebook page. \n“With extremely heavy hearts and a great deal of sadness to say Aidan has gone home to be with the lord Jesus Christ,” read the post. \nAidan was participating in drills at soccer practice in Cherokee County on Sept. 8 when he collapsed. Aidan’s coach said he wasn’t breathing and immediately began CPR. \n“I thought he was playing, and then I saw his eyes rolling into the back of his head,” his grandmother, Peggy Pickard Moore, told Channel 2 Action News in an interview last week. \nDoctors didn’t immediately know what caused Aidan to collapse but said it could be related to a congenital heart problem. \nThe death is an added burden to mother Ashley Heath who, according to a post, is a single mother and “managed to play the role of two parents.” \n“This comes with a great deal of stress and complication,” read the post. “One of those complications is making ends meet on a day-to-day basis.” \nFamily is asking that donations be made to Regions Bank to the account Prayers for Aidan Heath to cover funeral costs. Donations can also be made via PayPal. \nWhile Aidan’s loss is tough for his family, Moore said three people in three different states will be able to use his kidneys, liver and intestines. \n“Aidan’s journey has brought so many together in prayer,” Moore said in a Facebook post. “We want to thank everyone for all you have done for us and all your prayers for Aidan. Everyone has been so kind and your comments, prayers and thoughts have helped us through our darkest time and we want to thank you for that.”",

Mereka sukses menuai kemenangan dengan skor telak 3-1 ketika menghadapi Northampton dalam babak ketiga Piala Liga 2016-2017. \nLain halnya dengan United, Manchester City tampak berjuang keras menghadapi keganasan tim tuan rumah Swansea City. Tim besutan Francesco Guidolin tersebut tampil sangat memukau pada babak pertama. Meski demikian performa mereka semakin mengendur saat memasuki paruh kedua. \nHal tersebut dimanfaatkan Josep Guardiola untuk melancarkan strategi jitu untuk melakukan skema penyerangan. Terbukti The Citizen sukses menceploskan dua gol berkat sepakan Gael Clichy dan Alex Garcia di babak kedua. \nSementara Tottenham Hotspur merayakan pesta gol saat menjamu Gillingham di White Hart Lane. Terbukti skuad asuhan Mauricio Pochettino tersebut sukses menceploskan lima gol tanpa balas yang mengantarkan The Liliywhites maju ke tahap selanjutnya. \nBerikut hasil pertandingan babak ketiga Piala Liga 2016-2017: \nFulham City 1 – 2 Bristol City \nQueens Park Rangers 1 – 2 Sunderland \nSouthampton 2 – 0 Crystal Palace \nWest Ham United 1 – 0 Accrington Stanley \nStoke City 1 – 2 Hull City \nshare",

L'attaquant de Lyon ĂŠtait satisfait d'avoir lancĂŠ sa saison. Partager sur Facebook Tweeter 0 Partages «Savourez-vous particulièrement cette soirée avec deux buts ? Oui. C'était une bonne soirée pour l'équipe et pour moi. Nous avons réussi à gagner même si c'était mal embarqué au début. Nous avons trouvé les ressources pour l'emporter. Nous vous avons senti très bien par rapport au début de saison après cette intervention au genou (il a subi en septembre une arthroscopie du genou droit dont il avait été opéré il y a un an pour nettoyer l'articulation, ndlr)... Cette intervention m'a fait du bien. En début de saison j'avais cette petite gêne au genou. Cela m'empêchait d'être à 100%. J'espère maintenant que les blessures vont me laisser tranquille. Avec ce genou \"nettoyé\", vous sentez-vous maintenant totalement à l'aise ? Oui. Ca change la vie. Le chirurgien m'a nettoyé le ménisque. Il y avait un petit morceau qui traînait. Maintenant, je me sens libéré et c'est bien pour moi\". Êtes-vous surpris de redevenir, dès après cette intervention, le Nabil que vous étiez auparavant ? Non, je ne suis pas surpris. Cela me gênait. On a estimé avec le corps médical qu'il était nécessaire de pratiquer ainsi. On a beaucoup parlé d'un système en 4-3-3 inadaptéà vous. Qu'en pensez-vous ? Etes-vous mieux avec ce système avec deux joueurs devant ? Oui. J'ai toujours dit je me sens mieux devant, dans ce schéma de jeu. J'en avais parlé avec l'entraîneur. Il a décidé de me lancer dans ce système. Et ça c'est bien passé. Les critiques vous ont-elles touché en début de saison ? Non, pas du tout. Je sais que je n'étais pas bon et quand on est pas bon, il faut les accepter. Comment avez-vous savouré ces deux buts ? Bien, super bien. Nous avons mal commencé mais j'avais confiance en l'équipe, nous avions confiance en nous. Nous avons réussi à revenir au score et à prendre l'avantage. C'était une bonne soirée. Vous avez mis du temps à tirer ce penalty ? Avez-vous gambergé ? Oui, ça gamberge un peu (c'était son premier but de la saison en L1, ndlr). Il faut être serein. Il faut tirer libéré et ça a marché. Votre saison est-elle vraiment lancée ? Oui. Maintenant, ce n'est que le début et il reste encore beaucoup de matches. On va tenter de continuer sur cette lancée. Nous sommes bien. Vous fixez-vous un objectif pour cette saison ? Non, pas d'objectif particulier si ce n'est d'être le plus décisif possible. C'est mon rôle et aider l'équipe au maximum. Je sais que je ne suis pas encore à 100%. Il me faut encore beaucoup travailler pour retrouver toutes les sensations mais ça revient bien. Je me sens de mieux en mieux et il faut continuer. On a vu une belle complicité avec Rafael. Qu'en pensez-vous ? C'est un très bon joueur. Techniquement, il est très à l'aise et il est facile de s'entendre avec de tels joueurs.»",

Partager sur Facebook Tweeter 0 Partages Franck Passi, entraîneur de Marseille: «On n'a pas fait un bon match, on a fait beaucoup trop d'erreurs pour pouvoir le gagner et on a offert comme un cadeau à Rennes, ce match. Le premier but, le deuxième but, l'expulsion (de Machach, 65e)... Ce sont des erreurs qui théoriquement ne doivent pas arriver à ce niveau. Ce soir (mercredi soir), avec tout ce qu'on a donnéà l'adversaire, je crois que la victoire est amplement logique, même si à 5 minutes de la fin, je pense que mes joueurs pouvaient aller chercher aussi au plus profond d'eux-mêmes pour conserver ce match nul. Jusqu'à l'expulsion, on croyait à la victoire, peut-être même marquer un troisième but, parce qu'on avait encore un peu de fraîcheur sur un joueur comme Njie. Mais on a vu qu'il baissait physiquement et on a été obligé de le sortir pour pas qu'il ne se blesse et on a perdu de la profondeur et surtout on a moins fait mal et moins fait peur à l'adversaire. Tout le monde est conscient de ce qui se passe, il y a une guerre à gagner, il va falloir se lever demain matin (jeudi matin) avec l'idée d'aller battre l'équipe qu'on va rencontrer ce week-end (Nantes). A la fin du match j'étais en colère, oui, je le suis toujours d'ailleurs, même si je n'accable personne.»",

"title": "Yet Another Stephen King Story Will Be Coming To The Big Screen With ‘Hearts In Atlantis’",
"text": "Getty Image\nI’m just going to go ahead and call it: 2017 is going to go down in history as the year that Stephen King killed the superhero movie (and not a moment too soon). The prolific horror author has been selling some of his most beloved properties to movie and television studios at a rate that would give Stan Lee a hard-on in recent months, including a big budget feature remake of It , a possibly quadrilogy of films (and even a TV spinoff !) based on the Dark Tower series , a television series version of The Mist , and a movie adaptation of Revival from the same guy planning to pen an adaptation of The Stand . In short, Roland Deschain > Steve Rogers, Tony Stark, and Bruce Wayne combined — COME AT ME BROS.\nJust last week, it was announced that Netflix would be turning King’s 1992 psychological thriller Gerald’s Game into an original movie , and because Hollywood is about nothing if not taking a good idea and milking it dry, it is now being reported that the novella Hearts in Atlantis will be the next King story to receive a big screen adaptation as well.\nVariety passes along the details of the upcoming film, which will come from British director Johannes Roberts ( The Other Side of the Door ) and his regular writing partner, Ernest Riera.\n“As a teenager, discovering Stephen King’s books and their cinematic counterparts was what led me to want to become a filmmaker,” says Roberts. “The story ‘Hearts in Atlantis’ is my favorite piece of King’s writing. Turning this story into a movie had been a lifelong dream.”\nSet in (you guessed it) a small coastal Maine town in 1966, Hearts centers around “a group of college boys and their first time away from home, their obsession and self-destruction, and what it means to be an adult in a world where, in the face of a devastating war no one understands, adults can no longer be trusted.” The story was one of two novellas and three short stories to be included in King’s 1999 collection of the same name, and actually received a loose adaptation back in 2001 starring Anthony Hopkins that opened to mixed reviews and failed to recoup its budget at the box office. \nLet’s hope that Roberts’ vision for the film manages to take things in a slightly more intriguing direction, because I think the filmmaking industry could stand to have a few non-comic book adaptations actually make an impact at the box office. Otherwise, it’s just going to be the ad nauseam adventures of that pasty Steve Rogers from here on out — YEAH I SAID IT.\n",

"text": "\nEarly this morning, news spread that Shawty Lo was killed in a car accident . The entire hip-hop community celebrated his contributions to music and many artists mourned his death . One name who has been associated with Shawty Lo dating back to 2008 was T.I., and he turned to Instagram to offer a heart-felt tribute to Lo. \n“Damn!!! I just woke up to some Bullshit News…RIP to a true Westside Atlanta Legend You truly represented Bankhead to the fullest!!! My Heart goes out to his family,and his children as well. Even through our toughest times I must admit I was impressed,& kinda proud of how well you rep’d our hood,and how much you cared for it. It was a real relief to have someone else helping to lift Bankhead up & hold it there. Can’t say enough about how much you meant to the city. Glad we matured beyond our trivial personal differences in time enough to have a laugh about it as neighbors. For those of us who were around & “in the mix” in the mid-late 90’s,we know the “Legend of Lo” started waaaay before Music. We salute U G!!!! Rest easy,You’ll truly be missed.”\nBack in 2008, Shawty Lo’s “Dunn Dunn” took a swipe at T.I.’s roots not being from Bankhead, Atlanta. T.I. took offense to this and responded with “What’s Up, What Happenin’,” and infamously shot the video in Shawty’s neck of the woods. The relationship was mended in 2009 shortly before T.I. went to prison. \nT.I.’s tribute is perfect, because it captures what Shawty Lo meant to Atlanta. He may not have been the biggest name in hip-hop worldwide, but he was a legend in the A that helped plenty of individuals and, as T.I. says, has been doing his thing for decades. His presence within the city will surely be missed.\n",

MEN The ruined Maserati is among around 30 vehicles stranded in Cypress Place car park \n“When you look across the carpark there is a BMW, Mercedes, Maserati and Audi. \n“They have not been able to remove the pump to get all of the water out. It means we cannot get our cars out to get them assessed by the insurers.” \nMr Hutchison, a category manager for sports giants Adidas, added: “We don’t know if we can get insured anymore. Also what happens to the value of our flats? Read More \n“We are frustrated with how it has been managed. There must be a reason why this is happening.” Mr Hutchison said it was obligatory for anyomne who buys a flat to also buy a car parking space at £15,000. \nAccording to residents, it is the third time Cypress Place has flooded since it opened in 2012. MEN Several residents are facing having to write their vehicles off after the flood \nA spokeswoman for property managers Livingcity said: “Livingcity staff and contractors did everything they possibly could at the time to overcome the effects of such a huge storm, working throughout the night and continuing through the week on the clean-up operation. \n\"The top priority initially was to pump out all of the water in the car park, allowing lifts and other electrical items to be checked, made safe and signed off for operation, and to allow the team safe access inside. Read More No traffic gridlock but look out for 13-foot waves on 2 mile road which which goes underwater twice a day \n“United Utilities have been requested to remove a large pump, deployed to clear the flood water, which is blocking the entrance to the car park in question. Further to this, residents are advised not to visit their cars as sewage is present in the water that burst from the drains in the street. \n“We are awaiting insurers’ sign-off for the extensive specialist clean-up and sanitation works which will enable residents and their insurers to reach the cars safely. MEN The cars ended up under four feet of water after 30mm of rain fell in an hour \n\"We fully understand the frustrations of those who wish to progress their car insurance claims, but our utmost priority is the health and safety of both the residents and our employees and contractors. \n“Livingcity is taking every step we can at this point to investigate the flooding issues, but ultimately the massive influx of water was caused by heavily-reported extreme weather conditions and by the overflow of the nearby street drains, neither of which we are able to stop or control. \n\"We are in discussions with United Utilities with regard to the events of last week and we are providing twice-daily updates to all residents and car owners on our dedicated web portal, as well as responding by email and over the phone, and issuing letters. \n“We extend our sincere sympathies to all those affected by this freak storm and flash flooding.”",

"text": "A yacht is missing with a 20-year-old man on board ... more soon Government cracking down on dangerous dogs in new dog attack plan Last updated 10:59, September 22 2016 FILE PHOTO \nDangerous dogs must be neutered, and owners have to provide a \"dog-free\" house entrance. \nOwners of dangerous dogs will have to neuter them and provide at least one \"dog-free\" entrance to their house, the Government has announced. \nAssociate Local Government Minister Louise Upston has revealed a new national action plan to reduce dog attacks, which are on the rise across the country. \nUpston said the Government was making a number of law changes for \"dangerous and menacing dogs\" and their owners, who would face stricter controls. Ross Giblin \nA new national action plan to reduce dog attacks has been revealed by Associate Local Government Minister Louise Upston, with the Government keen to tackle an increase in dog bite incidents. \nAll high-risk dogs would have to be neutered and kept in a fenced-in area at their home, with \"dog-free access\" provided to at least one entrance for visitors. \nREAD MORE: \nOwners of high-risk dogs would also have to display signs at the front of their property alerting people of the risk, and ensure their dogs wore collars showing they were dangerous. \nIn addition, animal shelters would be prevented from adopting high-risk dogs to new owners. \nUpston said the new laws would be introduced to Parliament in February next year, while the Government would provide $850,000 to help fund the neutering of high-risk dogs over summer. \n\"Neutering has been proven to reduce aggression in dogs which is important as we move into summer months and the school holidays.\" \nThe three-part action plan would also include the development of a best practice guide for councils and public education campaign, Upston said.

"text": "One of the many fascinating things to come out of my chat with Josh Green (for Episode 3 of the podcast) was the still largely unappreciated role of Steve Bannon looming over the 2016 race. \nObviously, being Trump's campaign chairman in itself is a very big deal. Kellyanne Conway is the nominal campaign manager. But Bannon seems to be the top executive in the operation. And to the surprise of many (including myself), rather than signaling Trump going finally totally off he rails, Bannon is the first of Trump's three campaign chiefs to bring some level of discipline to the operation. Not a high bar. But it's been real and important. So that's point one.\nRead More → ",

"text": "A yacht is missing with a 20-year-old man on board ... more soon New Zealand Paralympic team overwhelmed by welcome as Rio success starts to sink in MARVIN FRANCE Last updated 11:07, September 22 2016 Fairfax \nLiam Malone, Sophie Pascoe and New Zealand's other Paralympics stars arrive home to fanfare at Auckland Airport. \nNew Zealand's Paralympic athletes were given a glimpse into how much their success resonated around the country as they arrived home to a hero's welcome in Auckland on Thursday morning. \nAbout 100 supporters gathered at Auckland Airport at 6am to congratulate the 31-strong team, who returned from the Rio Games with 21 medals - all on display in the arrivals hall. \nSwimming sensation Sophie Pascoe and blade runner Liam Malone, arguably the Games' biggest star, were particularly popular as fans were treated to selfies and autographs. DAVID WHITE/FAIRFAX NZ \nSophie Pascoe returned from Rio as New Zealand's most decorated Paralympian. \nKiwis were gripped by the event as the team matched New Zealand's most successful Paralympics with nine gold medals. \nREAD MORE: \nFor Pascoe, that their achievements helped boost the profile of Para-Sport made the four years of hard work even more worth while. Breakfast \nRecord-breaking Kiwi blade runner Liam Malone full of humour as he touches down in NZ, joking that \"being disabled you get attention anyway\". \n\"It's still early in the morning and to see this many people come out is just amazing to show how much support there is behind the Paralympic athletes,\" Pascoe said. \n\"It's been a long journey for me personally and obviously a very successful journey as well for the entire team. It's great to be back with family and friends to finally celebrate with them.\" \nPascoe won three gold and two silver medals in Rio to become New Zealand's most decorated Paralympian of all time. \nHer overall tally of 15 medals across three Games is one more than the late Eve Rimmer, although Pascoe said that incredible feat was simply a bonus. Ad Feedback \n\"I only learned about it the day I achieved [the record],\" she added. \n\"I only go out to do what I love which is to challenge myself against the rest of the world so to know that I'm the best Paralympian is amazing. It's a very humbling feeling to know that.\" \nMalone attracted the world's attention as much for his colourful quotes as his feats on the track, which is saying something. \nThe 22-year-old, who is studying a commerce degree at Victoria University in Wellington, twice broke Oscar Pistorius' Paralympic records in winning the men's 400m and 200m T44, while he also took silver in the 100m. \n\"I don't really think of it at all,\" Malone said of his super-star status. \n\"I always thought I only needed one shot, I wanted to put a face to the sport after Oscar had gone. There's been a bit of a vacuum in terms of someone to gain attention to my sport in particular, so to do that was really important.\" \nMalone said there was a strong team atmosphere in the group and took just as much satisfaction from his teammates' success as his own. \n\"Our small athletics group is a tight bunch and we have a good time together. We call ourselves 'Team Unprofessional' but when the time comes we show up and we do well.\" \nThere is little time to celebrate, though, with Malone going straight back to the books. \n\"I don't see myself celebrating till Christmas time,\" he added. \n\"It's just back to university and back to training. I'll be back to training within a week.\" \nWhile the athletes were quick to thank the fans for their support, it wasn't all one-way. \nAuckland resident Jay Leigh was one of many who were left inspired by their achievements over the past two weeks. \n\"I am mentally ill and it's so inspiring to see Paralympians represent New Zealand on an international level,\" said Ms Leigh, who described Pascoe as \"childhood hero\". \n\"It's just really cool to see the athletes represent New Zealand at such an amazing event, which is only once every four years so we don't get to see them perform that often.\" \nDespite winning her gold medal on the opening night of competition, long jump champion Anna Grimaldi said her victory was still a \"blur\". \nThe 19-year-old's stunned reaction on winning with her final attempt was one of the highlights of the Games - something she struggles to get her head around. \n\"It's crazy to think that,\" Grimaldi. \n\"I was so in the moment and overwhelmed. But I've been watching the videos and every time I watch them I'm just so happy.\" \nLike the majority of her teammates, Grimaldi's Rio experience has left her hungry for more. \n\"Big championships give you so much motivation. There's so much you can do and I'm really excited for the next four years.\" \nThe public has another chance to meet the team with a 'Welcome Home' event taking place at 10am on Friday at the AUT Millennium centre in Auckland. - Stuff",

Bismillah,” tulis Marissa di akun Instagram-nya. Marissa mengaku melalui pelaporan itu dia kembali belajar masalah hukum dan etika di masyarakat. Rencananya, hasil laporan Marissa akan direspons KPI pekan depan. “Semoga keadilan media masih bisa didapat di Indonesia,” sambungnya. Marissa juga mengetahui bahwa acara Rumpi sudah tiga kali mendapat teguran dari KPI.

"text": "All Teams All Teams Let's watch the Cardinals and Rockies battle it out in the form of a pregame standoff Email Print By Gemma Kaneko | \nBefore Wednesday's Cardinals-Rockies game had even begun, St. Louis had already tallied a win. Well, when it comes to anthem standoffs, anyway. Perhaps inspired by the Brewers and Reds last week , or, you know, any anthem standoff in the past decade, the Rockies' Carlos Estevez and the Cardinals' Jose Martinez heard the song end … and then they just kept standing there. \nEstevez had plenty of support from his teammates. Boone Logan even fitted him with a catcher's mask, probably so he'd be protected from stray balls in case he was still on the field when the game started. \nDon't worry, the rest of the Cardinals weren't about to leave Martinez out to dry -- they did quite literally the opposite: \nThe standoff went on so long that umpire Jim Joyce even tried to get Walt Weiss and Mike Matheny to intervene. But there was no need -- eventually Martinez was victorious: This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs. more from cut4 ",

"title": "Los alumnos argentinos son los que más repiten y crece la preocupación",
"text": "El debate ganó los medios hace dos años, cuando el gobierno de Scioli cambió el sistema de evaluación en la Provincia y estableció que la nota más baja en la secundaria sea el 4 y en la primaria los chicos pudieran “llevarse” previas, entre otras resoluciones. De fondo, el argumento de las medidas (dadas de baja este año) apuntaban hacia un mismo objetivo: bajar las altas tasas de repitencia, para así reducir los niveles de abandono en las escuelas.\nLa preocupación es legítima. Los alumnos argentinos son los que más repiten en la secundaria, de acuerdo a un estudio de CIPPEC, que comparó políticas y resultados educativos en América Latina entre 2000 y 2015. Según los últimos datos disponibles, la cifra de repitencia fue aumentando durante la última década, como consecuencia de la ampliación de la matrícula.\nMirá también: Es necesario conocer la realidad de las escuelas\nLas mayores dificultades están en el primer y segundo año de la secundaria, donde repite hasta el 15% de los chicos. A medida que avanzan en la escolaridad, la cantidad desciende: el promedio de los últimos tres años ronda el 6,7%. En la primaria también hay altas tasas, sobre todo en 6to y 7mo grado.\nLo peor es que repetir de año no hace que los chicos aprendan más, sino todo lo contrario, de acuerdo a un estudio del ministerio de Educación. Es más, los chicos de 6to grado que alguna vez repitieron obtienen resultados 10% inferiores en las pruebas de conocimientos.\nMirá también: La repitencia influye negativamente en los chicos\nLa repitencia afecta más a los chicos pobres. Para los especialistas, se debe a que muchos de ellos son la primera generación de sus familias que acceden a la secundaria, y la propuesta pedagógica no los contiene. “La escuela media tiene una organización perimida. Está organizada en bloques de materias que se cursan todas juntas en un año y, si no se aprueban todas menos de dos, se repite todo aunque ya se haya aprobado”, dice Guillermina Tiramonti, de Flacso.\nCada vez son más los expertos que cuestionan el sistema de repitencia. Para Rebeca Anijovich, de la Universidad de San Andrés, hay que renovar la escuela media. “Es clave el acompañamiento de la trayectoria escolar de cada alumno (por ejemplo, con tutorías integrales), así como estrategias preventivas que pueden aplicar las escuelas para ayudar a cada chico”, dice.\nMirá también: Mejor alfabetización, la clave para garantizar la comprensión lectora\nEl debate es profundo, porque no aparece la alternativa: nadie propone la “promoción automática”. Para Axel Rivas, de CIPPEC, “hay que reemplazar la repitencia con nuevas prácticas pedagógicas y modelos de organización institucional que logren desafiar y apasionar a los alumnos”. Motivar, acompañar, prevenir: todos verbos que hacen referencia a un profundo cambio. Por ahí vendría la solución.",

Fieles al guión, los hombres de Simeone se echaron atrás, juntaron las líneas, cerraron los pasillos interiores -por donde mejor se desenvuelve la MSN- y obligaron a que el partido se jugará en treinta metros. También puedes leer: Carlos Vela anota en la goleada de la Real Sociedad \nEl rojiblanco resulta un rival ‘odioso ‘ para cualquier grande. Siempre solidario, con las ayudas funcionando a la perfección, su propuesta es áspera, de difícil digestión y contrarresta cualquier atisbo de fútbol lúdico de su oponente. \nSi encima le añades la calidad que tiene delante, con jugadores que combinan velocidad, talento e instinto asesino como Griezmann, Carrasco o Gameiro, es lógico que a nadie le guste jugar contra el conjunto madrileño. \nApretando bien arriba, recuperando tras pérdida en casi cada presión, el Barça intentó sobreponerse a la incomodidad del choque, pero el Atlético apenas le dejaba espacios para la asociación. \nLos locales, con más voluntad que acierto, solo inquietaron a Oblak en tres disparos lejanos de Messi, Iniesta y Neymar en los primeros cuarenta minutos de juego. Los dos primeros los interceptó el meta esloveno y el tercero, una rosca envenenada del brasileño, se marcho fuera por poco. \nTambién puedes leer: Real Madrid no pasa de un empate ante Villarreal \nEl Atlético, más tímido al contragolpe de lo que en él suele ser habitual, amenazó a Ter Stegen con dos tiros de Carrasco -uno de ellos obligó a volar al portero alemán- y otro muy desviado de Filipe Luis. \nA ambos equipos les faltaba elaborar más las jugadas. Así que no fue nada extraño que el 1-0 llegara, a falta de cuatro minutos para el descanso, en un centro desde de la izquierda de Iniesta que Rakitic , uno de esos jugadores que sirve para todo, cabeceó solo de forma magistral. \nSalió Griezmann dispuesto a animar el partido tras la reanudación. Tuvo dos nada más empezar. En la primera se encontró con Ter Stegen y la segunda la envió al tercer anfiteatro cuando tenía solo a Carrasco. \nLas malas noticias para el Barça llegaron en forma de lesiones. Un Busquets griposo fue sustituido por Andre Gomes y Arda relevaba a Messi, que abandonaba el terreno de juego con cara de preocupación mientras se echaba mano al muslo derecho. \nFaltaba más de media hora por disputarse, el ‘Cholo’ olió la sangre y se fue a por el empate dando entrada a Torres y Correa por Saúl y Gameiro. \nEl argentino hizo el 1-1 en el primer balón que tocó al aprovechar un despiste defensivo de los azulgranas, con resbalón de Mascherano incluido, y sorprender a Ter Stegen con un golpeo seco a la cepa del poste derecho. \nSin embargo, los azulgranas no se vinieron abajo. Huérfanos de Messi, Neymar -esta vez sí- se echó al equipo a la espalda. Le secundó un Arda muy activo y el Barça buscó el segundo. \nEl astro brasileño puso a prueba por dos veces a Oblak, antes de habilitar a Piqué en una falta que el central catalán, impecable durante todo el partido, cabeceó ligeramente desviado. \nTambién puedes leer: Ochoa brilló con grandes atajadas, pero el Granada perdió \nJordi Alba a punto estuvo de hacer el 2-1, poco después, pero su disparo, con Oblak casi ya batido, se estrelló en la zaga visitante. \nFaltaban cinco minutos para el final, el Atlético parecía tocado y el Camp Nou empezó a rugir intuyendo que el partido tenía olor a victoria épica. \nPero el colchonero es un equipo que tiene más vidas que un gato. Un remate de cabeza de Godín obligó a volar a Ter Stegen par enviar el balón a córner y devolver los biorritmos de la grada a su sitio. \nAl final, hubo tablas en el primer partido grande de la temporada. Un empate inoportuno para ambos el día que el Real Madrid tropezaba en su estadio.",

Las Palmas pagaría un alto precio por esta jugada ya que además de encajar el segundo gol en contra perdió por roja directa al futbolista ghanés y el partido técnicamente quedó finiquitado. \nEl camino estaba ya muy allanado y los locales jugaron con cabeza para hacer valer su superioridad numérica para obtener un nuevo rédito goleador antes del descanso, en un remate de cabeza de Zurutuza que aprovechó uno de los muchos centros que hizo la Real desde la banda derecha. \nTambién puedes leer: Ochoa brilló con grandes atajadas, pero el Granada perdió \nEl vendaval de juego blanquiazul no se detuvo tras el descanso, las ocasiones se sucedieron y después de un remate intencionado de Xabi Prieto llegó el cuarto , de penalti materializado por Willian José tras derribar Simón a Oyarzabal. \nEl partido no daba respiro y en plena celebración de los vascos se produjo la jugada del gol del honor canario, conseguido por Tana de forma brillante. \nNo tendría más historia el partido que el retorno a los campos de Sergio Canales en un partido oficial nueve meses después de su grave lesión de rodilla.",

"text": "A Nanaimo mother is asking the RCMP to step in and order the removal of an online video showing her daughter being beaten near her high school.\nJulie Neufeld says her daughter Breanna went for a walk with a classmate last Thursday to reconcile differences they had and alleges the girl jumped her. \n\"As soon as they stepped off school property, the young lady attacked my daughter and started to viciously beat  her , pounding he r head  into the pavement numerous time s,  creating  a concussion and some  black  eye,  medi cal  issues,\" said Neufeld. \nWoman arrested Nanaimo RCMP investigated the attack , arrested the young woman who was allegedly involved in the altercation and have now  recommended charges. \nPart of the investigation included the use of a video that was recorded by fellow students. \nBut Neufeld said the problem with the video of the attack was her daughter was victimized again when it was set to music and posted to the Facebook page of the woman who allegedly attacked her.\n\"I am hoping the video can disappear  completely. I know with  social media  ther e is  a  really  fine line with being able to track down all the sources and being able to do it,\" said Neufeld. \"My priority is to make sure  this  young lady  doesn' t do this to  anyone  else .\"  \n\"There needs to be more awareness of how vicious bullying has become today. Being a victim of bullying myself when I was in high school, it is quite  personal  to me.\" \nRCMP lacks removal power The video has since been removed from the individual's personal Facebook page but has popped up on other social media sites. Neufeld was told the RCMP does not have jurisdiction to have it removed from the internet. \nRCMP Cpl. Jon Stuart said the video circulating in public is concerning, but it did serve as a valuable piece of evidence for their own investigation. \n\"I n this case, th ere was a video which was good for us, because it  supports an allegation. Often times, you have two people  involved  in an  alter cation  and no video, and no one is willing to come forw ar d,\" said Stuart.  \n\"With the rise of everyone having a cell phone and social media and everything is out ther e, that is why we are seeing more of t his.\"",

Rodrigo Duterte, que chamou Obama de 'filho da p...', ataca críticos da guerra às drogas por AFP \nPublicidade \nDAVAO, Filipinas - Enquanto chefes de Estado se reúnem de maneira diplomática na Assembleia Geral da ONU, o presidente filipino, Rodrigo Duterte, fez um discurso inflamado repleto de palavrões e gestos ofensivos contra a União Europeia, na reação mais recente às críticas internacionais sobre o número crescente de mortes em sua brutal repressão ao crime. Recentemente, ele chamara o presidente americano, Barack Obama, de \"filho da puta\". Veja também Obama aperta mão de presidente filipino que o chamou de 'filho da p...' \nDuterte pontuou seus insultos com um sinal grosseiro – levantando o dedo médio – depois que o Parlamento Europeu condenou \"a atual onda de execuções extrajudiciais e assassinatos nas Filipinas\". \n— Eu digo a eles: fodam-se. Vocês estão fazendo isso em expiação dos seus pecados — disse às autoridades locais em sua cidade natal, Davao (sul do país) na terça-feira (20). Os comentários foram filmados pela emissora ABS-CBN. \nO líder de 71 anos já havia reagido de forma similar anteriormente a críticas estrangeiras envolvendo sua guerra contra as drogas, chamando o presidente americano, Barack Obama, de \"filho da puta\" e amaldiçoando as Nações Unidas. \nDuterte venceu as eleições em maio, depois de prometer erradicar o comércio ilegal de drogas em seis meses e afirmar que 100 mil criminosos seriam mortos no processo. \nDesde que assumiu o cargo, em 30 de junho, cerca de 3 mil pessoas foram mortas, um terço delas suspeitas mortas a tiros pela polícia, e as demais assassinadas por agressores não identificados, de acordo com estatísticas da polícia. \nDuterte disse no domingo (18) que precisará estender sua guerra às drogas por outros seis meses, porque o problema das drogas é pior que o esperado.",

Usualmente fechado a novas tecnologias, somente em 2015 o país começou a investir no acesso amplo à rede. Veja também Revolução do wi-fi: internet provoca mudança de costumes em Cuba \nDe acordo com a imprensa estatal, o wi-fi será instalado na região mais popular e frequentada do Malecón até o fim do ano. O local, que já é muito popular, usualmente reúne cubanos que querem conversas, beber e ouvir músicas. \nO uso de internet nas residências cubanas sofre ainda com muitas restrições, sendo pouco utilizado pelos cidadãos comuns. Desde o ano passado, no entanto dezenas de pontos wi-fi foram instalados em áreas públicas, cobrando o equivalente a US$ 2 pela hora de uso — com um salário mínimo mensal estimado em US$ 25. \nNo ano passado, o governo da ilha relatou ter 65 pontos de wi-fi espalhados pelo território, e que planejava instalar cerca de outros 80 até o fim de 2016.",

Сообщение об этом опубликовано на официальном сайте украинского лидера. \nКак утверждается, у глав двух государств был долгий разговор. «Мы имели возможность обсудить дальнейшие шаги по имплементации минских договоренностей, решительные шаги по координации наших действий относительно того, чтобы мы составили \"дорожную карту\" реализации этих договоренностей, приоритеты компонента безопасности минских договоренностей», — рассказал Порошенко. \nОн добавил, что также в ходе переговоров речь шла о поддержке Вашингтоном украинских реформ. \nВ Нью-Йорке Порошенко встретился с кандидатом в президенты США от демократов Хиллари Клинтон. Он рассказал ей о ситуации в Донбассе и поблагодарил за поддержку Киева. Также политики обсудили укрепление трансатлантического единства и антироссийские санкции. \nПомимо этого у президента Украины были намечены переговоры с соперником Клинтон в борьбе за пост главы государства от Республиканской партии Дональдом Трампом, однако они не состоялись. По словам Порошенко, причиной стало несовпадение графиков. Foreign Policy ранее сообщал , что Трамп не ответил не приглашение президента Украины.",

Consumers should return the affected cartons to their place of purchase for full refunds. \nListeria can cause serious, sometimes fatal infections in young children and frail or elderly people, as well as those with weakened immune systems. Healthy people may suffer short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, but the infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among expectant mothers. \nLast year, Blue Bell halted sales and issued a voluntarily recall of all of its products due to bacteria contamination that was linked 10 listeria cases in four states, including three deaths, drawing regulatory scrutiny from federal and state officials. \nCopyright 2016 by The Associated Press.

"text": "It's time to focus laser-like attention on the meaning of a Donald Trump presidency for America's security.\nUntil now, the presumption that Trump wouldn't win or doesn't really mean what he says has led to insufficient scrutiny of how his presidency would threaten our safety. Many security experts —including leading Republicans — have raised concerns, but their protests haven't risen to the level of the danger.\nThe time for such complacency is past. Trump brags he will make America \"strong again\" but the policies he promotes would do exactly the opposite: emboldening our enemies, undercutting our allies and destroying America's clout in the world.\nSo let us imagine what America's security situation could look like in 2020, after one term of Trump as our commander-in-chief.\nEurope: Our most important alliance, with Europe's democracies, lies in tatters, after Trump's \"America First\" policy accelerated the break-up of the European Union and the demise of NATO.\nDonald Trump Seth Perlman / Associated Press Donald Trump Donald Trump (Seth Perlman / Associated Press) Trump tipped his hand in 2016 with an astonishing campaign appearance — in Mississippi — alongside Nigel Farage, the former leader of England's far-right Independence Party, who led a successful campaign for Britain to \"Brexit\" the European Union. As president, Trump openly supported Europe's other far-right (and racist) parties as they worked to destroy the political union that kept Western Europe stable for decades.\nHaving also declared his disdain for NATO, Trump closed down our bases in Germany and England (as well as in Japan and South Korea). He had claimed during the campaign that our allies didn't pay enough for our protection, telling CNN the benefit of those alliances was \"not big enough to bankrupt and destroy the United States.\"\nIn reality, our Asian allies paid a huge chunk of the base costs in their countries, while NATO allies paid lesser amounts. But the savings of relocating bases from Europe to America were minimal, since Trump didn't want to disband the transferred military units. What the Donald also refused to consider was the key importance of those bases in deterring Russia from undercutting Western democracies (and China from doing likewise in Asia).\nBy 2020, Russia has become the dominant influence in Europe, nibbling at the Baltics and Poland and annexing half of Ukraine. Moscow continues to fund far-right European parties that support the Kremlin's anti-American policies and its vision of authoritarian \"democracy.\"\nThis doesn't disturb President Trump, who had finally achieved his decade-long dream of building a Trump tower in Moscow, and has regular dinners with his buddy, Vladimir Putin . Trump now hosts a reality show on the Kremlin's global mouthpiece RT (Russian Television), which had already started interviewing Trump during the 2016 election season and offered Farage his own TV show the same year.\nAsia: After Trump withdrew America's forward Asian bases, China became the dominant player in Asia, taking firm control of many disputed islands and controlling the sea lanes. Deprived of the U.S. nuclear umbrella, Japan and South Korea have built nuclear weapons — which Trump said in the 2016 campaign was fine by him.\nThe nuclear arms race in Asia grows ever more dangerous and could threaten U.S. territory, but Trump's \"America first\" policy eliminated America's critical role as a stabilizer. Meantime, U.S.-China enmity has soared as Trump kept his promise to slap huge tariffs on Beijing, starting a trade war that has cost America millions of jobs.\nThe Middle East: Iran has gone nuclear. Soon after taking office, Trump kept his pledge to destroy the international treaty that had blocked any Iranian nuclear weapons for at least a decade, leaving Tehran free to race right up to breakout capacity. Trump realized the cost of another Mideast war was too high, and Israel hesitated to go solo. America's Gulf allies, realizing Trump had abandoned them, turned to Moscow for protection.\nTerror: Islamic terrorism has risen exponentially in the West and in Israel, as intelligence cooperation has splintered within Europe and among former NATO allies. Trump's responses are to (1) try muzzling U.S. media criticism, after asking Putin for pointers, and (2) blaming everything on illegal immigrants, or other internal \"traitors.\" (However, he has been unable to deport the 11 million or get an outraged Mexico to pay for a wall.)\nU.S. standing: Global respect and admiration for America have tanked, as the erratic Trump insults former friends and praises its adversaries. Nations no longer look to the United States as the exemplar of liberal democracy. Americans are less safe, but Washington has decreasing leverage to protect them.\nPerhaps Trump won't do half of what he's pledged, but the risk is too great and the security threat too huge, dwarfing any of Hillary Clinton's flaws. But for anyone still sitting on the fence in this election, the time to face up to the danger is now.\nTrudy Rubin is a columnist and editorial-board member for the Philadelphia Inquirer. \nCopyright © 2016, Sun Sentinel Europe Donald Trump Russia Vladimir Putin European Union Republican Party",

"text": "Kat Smith September 21, 2016 When it comes to finding a forever home, there are a few demographics of pets in shelters who get the short end of the stick. Kittens and puppies are the most likely to be adopted, while senior animals often end up calling the shelter their permanent residence. Special needs animals, specifically those who live with a physical disability , are also less likely to find a family with humans who visit the shelter in hopes of finding their new best friend. But from what we’ve seen, physical disability does not coincide with any animal’s ability to love . That’s why at Adăpostul Speranța , a dog shelter in Romania, they see to it that every disabled dog who ends up there gets the chance at life that they deserve. At Adăpostul Speranța, every dog’s life, no matter what their physical capabilities, is valuable. Instead of putting disabled dogs to sleep, this shelter sees to it that every dog who needs a wheelchair gets one. The shelter believes that with proper care, every dog can live a happy life. Looking at these photos, we can tell that these pups have nothing to be sad about. The only difference between these happy puppies and able-bodied dogs are the wheelchairs that help them race around and play. According to the shelter , “the happiness of our paraplegic dogs is our reward.” Warms your heart, doesn’t it? \n\n\nAble-bodied or not, every pup’s life is worth saving — and we’re glad that Adăpostul Speranța understands that. However, some wheelchairs have worn out and with the Romanian winter approaching fast, the shelter does not currently have the means to pay for new ones. But we can help keep these pups’ tails wagging. \nRead more about how you can help Adăpostul Speranța give wheelchairs to their resident dogs by going here . To learn more about them, visit their official website . \nAll image source: Adăpostul Speranța /Facebook   some recent posts below:",

From being on the watch for other dogs that might pick a fight, to cars, and cruel humans who wish to do them harm, homeless dogs lead quite the stressful existence. While it is heartbreaking to think about the pain that these pups have to endure, we are able to find solace in the face that there are plenty of kind people working to give them a better life . \nJust take the example of this video from Animal Aid Unlimited . This poor dog was found with a devastating head injury. Many would have seen the state of this pup and given up hope – but the rescuers from Animal Aid didn’t even flinch. In no time at all, they had gotten the pup back to their shelter and started with medical treatment. Although the recovery was long and definitely difficult, the dog, which they named Muriel, made a full recovery! \nThanks to the kindness of the Animal Aid team, Muriel will live a long and very happy life!

"text": "Kat Smith September 21, 2016 \nThe excuses that humans come up with to justify taking the life of an animal are perplexing. Rhinos are critically endangered because their horns are considered a valuable ingredient in some forms of Traditional Asian Medicine. The clincher? Their horns are made from keratin, meaning that they are no different from your fingernails. Elephants have their tusks torn from their bodies to be sold as ivory , which is often used to make superfluous decorative objects. But one species that often gets overlooked are mobula rays, also known as “devil rays.” Though they are not endangered, devil rays are killed for their gills. As with rhino horns, they are used in a health tonic in Traditional Asian Medicine. \nThe lack of awareness for the danger facing devil rays is exactly why Hannah Fraser, a dancer known for her underwater performances as a mermaid and David Langlois, a model, partnered with conservation cinematographer Shawn Heinrichs to create this beautiful dance with devil rays on the ocean floor. \nThis incredible team hopes this video is able to raise awareness for rays while the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) is taking place. This convention, which happens every three years, is a time when world governments come together to issue protections for certain species. \nHeinrichs, Fraser, and Langlois, hope to get devil rays can be voted into Appendix II, which is reserved for species “that are not necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so unless trade is closely controlled,” at the upcoming convention. With the rising demand for gills, the future of mantas across the world is threatened – so every step toward their protection counts. \nWe applaud the time and effort that the trio put into creating this beautiful dance on the ocean floor of La Paz, Mexico, one of the only locations in the world where one can dive with devil rays . We cannot and will not stand by waiting until it’s too late to save this graceful species of manta ray — they deserve our protection now. \nHelp raise awareness for devil rays by sharing this video and using #LoveMiniMantas on social media!   some recent posts below: Instead of Putting Down Disabled Dogs, This Romanian Shelter Gives Them All Wheelchairs! \nThis awesome shelter provides wheelchairs for every dog that needs one.",

"text": "Juegos Paralímpicos: las postales de Efraín Sotacuro en Río \nLos últimos metros de la gran final del Campeonato Mundial de triatlón en Cozumel, México, siguen dando de qué hablar. \nPrimero fue el sorprendente desfallecimiento del británico Jonathan Brownlee a 300 metros cuando tenía el título mundial al alcance de la mano, lo que dio paso al emotivo gesto que protagonizó su hermano, Alistair , quien detuvo su carrera, lo tomó por el brazo y lo ayudó a finalizar la prueba. \nJonny Brownlee sufrió un fuerte golpe de calor en el Mundial de Triatlón. Su hermano mayor Alistair lo ayudó a cruzar la meta. (Foto: EFE / Video: YouTube) \nJonathan terminó la prueba en segundo lugar, pero no pudo evitar que el español Mario Mola se coronara campeón del mundo. \nLo que sí logró el menor de los hermanos británicos fue quedarse con el subcampeonato, por delante de otro triatleta español, Fernando Alarza. \nEs aquí donde está el fondo de la posición de la Federación Española de Triatlón (FETRI) que, sin entrar a valorar el lado humano y sentimental del gesto de los hermanos Brownlee, considera que en realidad se trató de una acción ilícita. \nEspaña fue el gran protagonista del mundial de triatlón al quedar campeón con Mario Mola y en tercer lugar con Fernando Alarza. (Foto: Getty Images) \nEn defensa de sus intereses \nLa FETRI presentó un recurso al final de la prueba solicitando la descalificación de los hermanos Brownlee, pero el Jurado de Competición de la Unión Internacional de Triatlón (ITU, por sus siglas en inglés) lo rechazó de manera unánime en base al Apéndice K, Regla 7, del reglamento, el cual establece que los atletas pueden recibir ayuda de otro competidor, oficial técnico u oficial de carrera. \n\"Debe tenerse presente que la situación denunciada tuvo incidencia en el resultado tanto de la prueba final de Cozumel como del Gran Final de las Series Mundiales de Triatlón 2016, afectando directamente a resultados deportivos de triatletas españoles\", expresó la FETRI en un comunicado. \nPese a la ayuda, Jonathan Brownlee no pudo conseguir el título mundial. (Foto: AP) \nEl organismo español asegura que no tiene nada en contra de ningún triatleta, pero reiteró que tiene que velar por \"sus propios intereses y los de sus deportistas\". \nEs por eso que una vez \"analizados los hechos acontecidos\" presentará un \"recurso de apelación ante el Tribunal de Arbitraje de la ITU\". \nLa FETRI considera que \"una correcta aplicación e interpretación de la reglamentación debería conllevar la descalificación de los deportistas implicados\". \n¿Confusión? \nPara la federación, la acción entre los hermanos Brownlee \"se trató de una situación en la que se produjo una evidente ayuda de un participante a otro, no estando permitida ni prevista la misma en la reglamentación aplicable\". \nEn el texto agrega que, pese a la explicación que acompañó la decisión del Jurado de Competición en Cozumel, \"admitir ayudas o apoyos entre participantes que no se encuentren expresamente previstas en la normativa compromete la propia esencia de una especialidad deportiva individual\". \nLa conducta de los hermanos Brownlee fue apreciada y admirada en diferentes partes del mundo, hasta el punto que varias personalidades, como JK Rowling, autora de Harry Potter, y Jessica Ennis-Hill, campeona mundial de heptatlón, tuvieron palabras de elogio para los triatletas británicos. \nDe prosperar la apelación de la FETRI, Alarza ascendería al segundo lugar en detrimento de Jonathan Brownlee con lo que España tendría al campeón y subcampeón mundial de triatlón. \nLEE TAMBIÉN...",

"text": "Marcado julgamento de acusados de matar agente Deise Alves 21/09/2016 - 19h50min Agente penitenciária Deise Alves, foi assassinada a tiros em São José, em 2012. Foto: Arquivo PEssoal / Arquivo Pessoal A Justiça marcou para o dia 29 de novembro o júri popular dos acusados do assassinato da agente penitenciária Deise Alves , há quatro anos, em São José, na Grande Florianópolis. O julgamento será a partir das 8h no Fórum de São José. A determinação é da juíza Marivone Koncikoski Abreu, da 1ª Vara Criminal de São José, dada na semana passada. Entre os réus estão as principais lideranças do crime organizado de Santa Catarina , que são criminosos do 1º ministério da facção Primeiro Grupo Catarinense (PGC). Eles cumprem pena na Penitenciária Federal de Mossoró, no Rio Grande do Norte. A juíza estabeleceu que esses réus deverão acompanhar o júri por videoconferência, ou seja, não serão transferidos a Santa Catarina para prevenir lesão à ordem pública. A previsão é que o julgamento poderá se estender por até dois dias. Os réus cujas informações ainda estariam em prisão federal são Evandro Sérgio Silva, o Nego Evandro; Rudinei do Prado, o Derru; Adílio Ferreira, o Cartucho e Gian Carlos Kazmirsk, o Jango. Marciano Carvalho dos Santos, acusado de atirar em Deise, também vai a julgamento, mas não é acusado de associação criminosa — Marciano responde em liberdade. A juíza requisitou ao comando do 7º Batalhão da Polícia Militar a segurança no Fórum diante da repercussão e comoção social causadas pelo fato. Assassinato teve grande repercussão Deise era mulher do então diretor da Penitenciária de São Pedro de Alcântara, o agente Carlos Alves, e foi executada por engano no lugar do marido, no dia 26 de outubro de 2012. Três homens, em uma moto e em um carro seguiram o veículo de Carlos Alves. Quando o veículo estacionou, na frente da casa de um familiar, no Bairro Roçado (Rua João Fernando Pereira), Deise desceu e foi baleada. Depois do assassinato, os presos do PGC ordenaram uma onda de atentados nas ruas, em retaliação às torturas que dizem ter sofrido na Penitenciária de São Pedro de Alcântara. A reportagem não conseguiu contato com os advogados de defesa dos réus na noite desta quarta-feira. Tópicos",

"text": "鉅亨網編譯郭照青 4 小時前 \n自聯邦公開市場委員會 (FOMC) 7 月會議後接獲的訊息顯示，勞工市場持續轉強，經濟活動已自今年上半年所見的溫和速度加速。儘管近幾個月失業率少有變動，但平均而言，就業成長一直穩固。家庭支出一直成長強勁，但企業固定投資疲弱。通貨膨脹持續低於委員會的 2% 長期目標，部份原因係反應能源價格早先下跌及非能源進口價格下降。近幾個月，平均而言，根據市場衡量的通貨膨脹率仍低，大多根據調查衡量的長期通貨膨脹預期則少有變動。 \n為符合法定任務，委員會尋求促進最大就業與物價穩定。委員會預期，在貨幣政策立場緩慢調整的情況下，經濟活動將以溫和速度擴張，勞工市場情況將進一步有所轉強。預期短期內，通貨膨脹仍將偏低，部份原因係能源價格先前下跌，但中期將上升至 2%，因能源與進口價格先前下跌的暫時性影響將消退，且勞工市場將進一步轉強。經濟展望的短期風險，似乎大致平衡。委員會將持續密切監督通貨膨脹指標及全球經濟與金融的發展。 \n在這種情況下，委員會決議維持聯邦基金利率目標範圍於 0.25% 至 0.5%。委員會認為，調高聯邦基金利率的情況已經強化，但決定暫時等待持續邁向目標的進一步證據。貨幣政策立場仍然寬鬆，藉以支持勞工市場情況進一步改善並重返至 2% 通貨膨脹。 \n在決定未來調整聯邦基金利率目標範圍的時機與幅度方面，委員會將評估有關最大就業與 2% 通貨膨脹目標的已實現與預期的經濟情況。這項評估將考量廣泛訊息，包括勞工市場情況，通貨膨脹壓力與通貨膨脹預期指標，及金融與國際發展數據。由於目前通貨膨脹低於 2%，委員會將密切注意邁向其通貨膨脹目標的實質與預期的進展。委員會預期，經濟情況將以確保聯邦基金利率僅能緩慢上升的情況進展，聯邦基金利率可能仍將低於預期的長期水平一段時間。然而，聯邦基金利率的實際走勢將視即將公布的數據所顯示的經濟展望而定。 \n委員會仍維持現行的政策，將持有機構債券與機構抵押貸款擔保證券所支付的本金，再投資機構抵押貸款擔保證券，並於拍賣時，將到期的政府債券展期，委員會並預期將持續此一做法，直到聯邦基金利率水平正常化已有大幅進展。這項政策，藉著讓委員會持有大量較長期證券，當有助維持寬鬆的金融情況。 相關新聞",

"text": "Photos Union minister for water resources Uma Bharti with chief minister of Andhra Pradesh N Chandrababu Naidu and his Telangana counterpart K Chandrasekhar Rao at the Apex Council meeting in New Delhi on Wednesday | Shekhar Yadav \nHYDERABAD: It is a win-win situation for both AP and Telangana at the first Apex Council meeting held in Delhi on Wednesday. For Telangana, Palamuru-Rangareddy and Dindi Lift irrigation projects were not shelved outright. However these projects were referred to a technical committee and they will be vetted jointly by chief ministers of the two states and would be referred to the Central Water Commission (CWC). \nThus, the AP government succeeded in stalling the projects for some more time. On the other hand, TS wanted 90 tmc share in compensation to AP's diversion of Godavari waters to Krishna basin through Pattiseema and Polavaram. AP got a relief in that TS was not against AP diverting Godavari waters to Krishna basin. \nThe first Apex Council meeting was chaired by Union water resources minister Uma Bharathi as per the direction of the Supreme Court with regard to case filed by AP farmers against Telangana constructing Palamuru-Rangareddy and Dindi irrigation projects. \nDuring the meeting, both the chief ministers presented their cases on projects on Krishna and Godavari rivers. \nPresenting its arguments, AP said that Palamuru-Rangareddy and Dindi are new projects and the Tribunal did not allocate water for them. TS argued that there were not new projects and they were sanctioned by combined AP. \nGiving its presentation, TS displayed video-footage of Prime Minister Narendra Modi during an election campaign at a public meeting in Mahbubnagar on April 22, 2014. Modi then promised to complete Palamuru-Rangareddy project. Telangana chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao also placed the copies of manifestos of Congress, BJP and TDP before the meeting which promised construction of Palamuru-Rangareddy to make it a point that these were not new projects. \nThere was unanimity at the meeting on three issues including installing telemetry system wherever they want, for water gauging. Both states wanted this so that we know quantity of water in each river and how much is flowing into each state. \nIt was also agreed that a joint committee, comprising of engineers from the two states and from the Central Water Commission, will be constituted to study availability of water in the river basin. \nSpeaking to reporters later, Uma Bharti said the meeting was held in a cordial atmosphere.",

"text": "iOS 10.1 will bring Portrait mode to iPhone 7 Plus Developer beta of iOS 10.1 is out now with new mode Public beta of iOS.1 will likely release on 23 September New mode lets you take portraits with a bokeh-like effect Comment When Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 Plus earlier this month, it introduced a depth-of-field camera trick that's exclusive to the device. \nThe feature, dubbed Portrait mode, wasn't quite ready for release when iOS 10 started rolling out last week. However, according to Matthew Panzarino of TechCrunch , iPhone 7 Plus owners will be able to test the new feature in the public beta of iOS 10.1, which will reportedly release starting 23 September for anyone enrolled in Apple's public beta programme. It's free and easy to join. Pocket-lint explained how to become an iOS 10 beta tester here \nThe developer version of that beta is actually available now, but of course, you must be a developer to get it up and running on your phone. Still, it includes the new camera mode, which is designed to mimic the kind of shallow depth of field you see in images taken with a high-end DSLR. In other words, these types of images usually have a front subject that stands out over a blurred background. \nIn addition to the usual wide-angle lens, a telephoto lens is located on the rear of iPhone 7 Plus. Apple has devised a way to use both lenses at the same time to mimic depth of field when taking portrait shots. To use the new mode after installing the iOS 10.1 beta, go to Apple's Camera app, then slide over to the Portrait mode, and the mode should prompt you to move back. What is bokeh? Here's the photography effect explained \nWhen you capture in Portrait mode, the camera snaps two photos: one regular and one with blur applied to the background. Apple's built-in image signal processor scans the scene, then applies machine-learning techniques to recognise people in the image, and ultimately creates a depth map using the device's two cameras, which results in an image where the people are in focus while the background has a bokeh-like effect. \nApple previously said Portrait mode would roll out in an official update scheduled to hit consumers' phones \"later this year\".",

"text": "Despite Budget Woes, US Air Force Pushing for Nuclear Missile Modernization © AFP 2016/ BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI 0 65 0 0 Faced with an aging nuclear arsenal, the US Air Force (USAF) is seeking funds to modernize its intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) stockpile and develop a new nuclear cruise missile known as the Long Range Standoff (LRSO). \nThe US government has known for years that it’s Minuteman III ICBM arsenal is in danger of falling behind. While the Air Force was granted approval to develop up to 400 new missiles, that effort stalled last month in response to budget concerns. © AP Photo/ U.S. Air Force via AP Surprise! America’s New Nuclear Missile Will Cost Way More Than Projected Air Force officials continue to push for Minuteman replacements. Speaking during the Air Force Association’s Air, Space & Cyber Conference 2016 on Monday, Lt. Gen. Jack Weinstein argued that updating the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent is critical. \nHe also discussed the need to replace the Air Launched Cruise Missile to be replaced with the nuclear LRSO. \n\"I think the LRSO is the most critical piece of the modernization effort,\" he said, according to Defense Tech . \nThe cruise missile could, in theory, be launched from any American bomber. \nWeinstein added that he preferred to discuss the cost of the two programs on another day, which is odd given the budgetary problems that have plagued the Air Force’s missile proposals in the past. US Plans to Modernize Nuclear Triad are ‘Foolish’ \nThe USAF originally estimated that replacing the Minuteman IIIs would cost $62.3 billion. Last month, a the Pentagon was forced to delay the program after a cost assessment report from its Defense Acquisition Board found that figure to be a severe underestimate. \nThe program is now expected to cost roughly $85 billion, a 36% increase. \nAdditionally, development of the LRSO is expected to cost at least $20 billion. The USAF has already released a statement calling on defense contracting firms to submit bids . \n\"The LRSO weapon system will be a cost-effective force multiplier for B-52, B-2, and B-21 aircraft to credibly deter adversaries and assures US allies of our deterrent capabilities,\" the statement said.",

"title": "Apple Car: Here's why Apple wants to buy British automaker McLaren",
"text": "Apple is reportedly in talks with McLaren Might acquire or ink an investment deal with McLaren McLaren acquisition would benefit Apple's Project Titan Comment Apple is reportedly considering another acquisition, but this one stands out from all the others because it involves McLaren. \nAccording to The Financial Times and The New York Times , Apple is attempting to buy British automaker McLaren - or at the very least, it is discussing a strategic investment. McLaren, which is best known for its Formula One racing team and P1 hybrid car, not only makes a range of supercars but also has a consulting division and a technologies group that supplies parts. Apple Car: What's the story so far on Project Titan? \nKeep in mind Apple is reportedly developing a car, Project Titan, which is rumoured to be electric and might have autonomous capabilities. The Cupertino, CA-based company recently recruited a former longtime Apple executive, Bob Mansfield , to lead the project, though newer reports claimed Apple has cut many jobs in the division in an attempt to narrow the project's scope. \nMcLaren is valued between $1.3 and $2 billion. While Apple declined to comment, McLaren has already denied the reports, saying it is not in discussion with Apple \"in respect of any potential investment\", according to The Verge . \nStill, here's why Apple has probably considered buying McLaren. McLaren \nTechnological expertise \nA McLaren acquisition would give Apple the expertise and experience it needs to quickly develop a car itself, as there's no denying that McLaren has lots of technological and engineering prowess when it comes to manufacturing drivetrains and vehicle control systems. \nThe company, which sold 1,654 cars in 2015 , makes sports cars and has roughly 5,000 employees working across six different divisions that include automative, racing, marketing, and automative supplying (that last bit means it has plenty of experience with supplier-OEM deals, too). Let's also not forget that it has a consulting division that works across several industries to provide R&D. McLaren \nNext-gen innovation \nMcLaren has used advanced, premium materials such as carbon composites, aluminum, and carbon fiber in the past. And it's very familiar with electric vehicles (with the most famous example being its P1 hybrid that traveled up to six miles on electric power) and high-performance Formula One race cars, all of which suggests it has the gumption to develop a next-generation car. McLaren \nSize and convenience \nMcLaren is small. It's a privately-owned, independent carmaker, so an acquisition is logistically possible for Apple. Plus, it's conceivable that McLaren would continue operating its automotive and racing divisions after an acquisition. Beats, which Apple acquired a couple years ago, still develops and sells headphones , even as Apple works to integrate Beats’ tech into its own stuff. McLaren \nApple-like mind \nMcLaren's Technology Centre was designed in 2004 by Foster + Partners, the same firm making Apple’s spaceship campus and many Apple stores. This building highlights its surrounding landscape, using water from a lake for energy-efficient cooling purposes. There’s even a wind tunnel for aerodynamic testing. The McLaren Production Centre was also designed by the firm. \nBased on its state-of-the-art headquarters, approach to making vehicles, and overall ethos, it's clear that McLaren is very similar to Apple in terms of aesthetics and using breakthrough technology. We're very interested in what the two could do together. One can only hope.",

"text": "from £119 | £249 (as reviewed) For \nGood heart rate performance, good GPS tracking, new route tracking is useful for travellers, shares data with other platforms, gives you phone-free music Against \nDesign is getting a bit stale, no play to wider smartphone connectivity like notifications, MySports app isn't great, still needs a connection to a PC for full functionality Comment Waking early in the city offers plenty of unique advantages to the urban runner. It's a chance to run as the local population is wiping the sleep from its eyes, going about the routine of preparing for the day, heading to work, heading home from nights out, setting up market stalls and opening shops. \nA waking city is something to experience, offering a different perspective. And for those who travel, that early morning run makes it feel as though you actually went somewhere and did something. With the TomTom Spark 3 sports watch, which is focused on running, cycling and swimming activity, that's now so much easier. TomTom Spark 3 review: Design and build \nTomTom has stuck to a single design formula for a couple of iterations of its sports devices. In the Spark, the body is one piece that fits into a rubber strap. On the Spark 3 this is a new strap that's softer and a little more comfortable to wear, but not a huge change from the previous version. Pocket-lint \nIf you want to buy new straps that's easy enough as TomTom offers loads of options for around £20-30. Yes, the old Spark fits into the new straps too, if that's what you're thinking. \nThe design sees a 22 x 25mm display sitting on top of the body, with a curved tongue offering a four-way controller for easy navigation of the menus and screens. There's no touchscreen to fiddle with and the controller is distinct, so you know you've pressed it, making controls nice and simple. \nThe downside of this design is that to charge the watch you have to remove the strap and connect it to the bespoke charger which clips onto the bottom of the tongue; the upside to this equation is that the charger attaches securely, so there's no worry that a magnetic charger didn't connect properly. Pocket-lint \nThe Spark 3 is identical to the older devices, so there's nothing to tell them apart and the interface is simple, hierarchical and monotone as it was before. In fact, there's been little change since the TomTom Runner launched in 2013, and even the new Adventurer repeats this design, so things are getting a little samey. \nThere are no customisations on offer and although TomTom offers 24/7 activity tracking - allowing you to set targets for steps or distance for example, and sleep tracking - this is strictly a sports watch, with no leaning towards other connected options, like smartphone notifications. TomTom Spark 3 review: Route tracking \nThe Spark leverages TomTom's experience in GPS for route tracking. The addition and the biggest change in the Spark 3 over previous versions is better support for routes: whereas previously GPS was used to record your location for you to view via TomTom MySports, the Spark 3 now lets you track routes in real-time on the watch itself. Pocket-lint \nThe idea is to allow you figure out where you are, where you've been, and let you get back to where you started. Route exploration is one of the joys of running and the Spark 3 allows you turn right instead of left and figure out through the trace where you have to get back to. \nThis isn't about mapping: unlike the Garmin Epix , which will show you topographical maps, the TomTom presents a simple traced line that, thanks to the new onboard compass, you'll be able to find your way back to. \nIn practice it's more useful than it might sound. If heading out in a strange location you don't have to worry about looking at a map or remembering every point of interest - and you're not restricted to out and back routes, because it's fairly easily to run more randomly and return to the start location. Pocket-lint \nWhen running, all you have to do it head into the heart-rate stats and press up to see the trace. This offers two views: one that's a larger view showing kilometres; the other a zoomed-in view to a few hundred metres. Generally, you can glance at the larger view to get back to somewhere you've been previously, then switch to the closer view to zoom back in and get on the same path again. \nThe simplicity of the display makes it ideal for running, as it's all about glancing and confirming without breaking stride. TomTom Spark 3 review: Adding routes \nThe other side of this ability to draw routes is about planning where you're going to run. You can save trails you've run previously as routes so you can repeat them, or, and perhaps more exciting, is the ability to upload GPX files to add new trails. \nThis is a little more advanced, for those who know where they are going and what route they want to run, but it does mean that you can get a route that a friend has run, or download a route from the internet to put onto your watch. Pocket-lint \nAdding a GPX route to your Spark 3 will mean connecting the watch to a PC and using the TomTom MySports Connect app to open up the browser to sync to the device. \nYou can rename routes to make them more memorable to you, and then find them in the \"trails\" section of the menu. When you go to start a run, you simply have to head down and select that trail, so you can follow the path you took before - again with two views; the overview and the 100m view within easy access. TomTom Spark 3 review: Sports performance \nOne of the things we've liked about previous iterations of the Spark is the accuracy of things like the heart-rate sensor. There are now many devices that will monitor your pulse, but many are inconsistent, inaccurate and frequently drop out and give you extraneous results. \nThe TomTom Spark 3 is solid in its delivery of heart-rate monitoring and offers a range of different stats on the run, like heart-rate zone so you can easily see what you're doing relative to personal capacity, what the training effect of that is and how it can fit into your fitness plan. Pocket-lint \nThis keen HR tracking is also paired with good GPS results. We've found this to be consistent with other devices, like our usual Garmin Forerunner, so the distance is pretty well recorded, for example. \nThe recording of the route can be a little off, although in the grander scheme of things, the distance is pretty close to the actual route distance, even if the trace line that you view sees you weaving across roads, into rivers or cutting corners. We suspect this comes down to the frequency with which the Spark records the GPS position - which is not uncommon for GPS devices. \nHowever, the Spark 3 can be a little sluggish to pickup a GPS location at times. To help solve this, connection to the MySports app on your smartphone will transfer over QuickGPSfix data. This can be a little varied in performance, especially when travelling. We've arrived somewhere new, connected to the app and been good to go. On return, we've sometimes found ourselves waiting for a really long time for the location to be found - even after syncing with the app. \nOne of the downsides is that in the normal running mode you can't even start running without a GPS fix. The treadmill option will allow you, if you can't be bothered to wait. Pocket-lint \nThe best advice (and we've had to do this with other devices too) is to get your watch looking at the sky well in advance, so you don't have that delay when you're standing there ready to run. \nThere's no option for a footpod which might add accuracy in such circumstances, but there is support for a cadence sensor and chest strap heart-rate monitor, which gives better support for cyclists who might want to mount the Spark 3 on their handlebars. \nThe high contrast display of data means it's easy to glance at your Spark 3 and see how you're going, with plenty of screens to scroll through using the four-way controller to get to the stats that you want. For those running in the dark, there's also illumination so you can see what's going on. \nThe TomTom Spark doesn't automatically identify your sports, which some smartwatch devices will attempt to do, but we're happy with this. If you want to swim or cycle, you select those options and the stats you're given are tailored to your view. There's no open water swimming options, though, instead the Spark 3 relies on lengths, with you manually entering the size of the pool. Pocket-lint \nAlthough there's support for a range of activity types, there's no combined multisport option, so it's no good for tracking your triathlon, unless you want to constantly stop and start the watch, which you'll forget to do when you're whipping off a wetsuit and putting on your bike helmet at pace. This is a criticism we've had of the Spark range since the beginning, but as auto-detection isn't possible we can see why this feature still lacks. \nWe've found the battery life to be good for about three or four runs before you'll want to charge. Of course that's dependent on lots of factors, like whether you play music, how far you runs are and for how long, and if you're using it all the time for tracking or just for specific sport. TomTom's official figures say five hours of HR, GPS and music; 11 hours of GPS capture; or several weeks of activity wear. TomTom Spark 3 review: MySports app and website \nNo device is complete today without an app and with any sportswatch you want a method of examining and compiling your data. Whether you're a beginner wanting to track your weekly distance gains, or an advanced runner wanting to see how your heart responded when you started those hill repeats, stats are for champions. \nTo get started is a bit of a fiddle, as you'll be invited to register the Spark by connecting to your computer. You can ignore that, if you want, but for the best results you'll need to connect up and sign into your TomTom MySports account. It's here you'll get software updates and more functions, so the Spark 3 is still very much a device that needs to be connected by wire at some point in its life. \nThis MySports account is the same as you'll sign into on the app too, with the same data being presented across both. The advantage of using the connection to your PC is that it's solid: you plug in the cable and it works, whereas the connection to your phone can be a little temperamental, losing the connection and asking you to pair the device again, which is frustrating. Pocket-lint \nThe PC interface which sits in the browser will also let you add GPX routes as we've mentioned, as well as save your runs as routes for the future, which the smartphone app doesn't. \nSo the app is a little way behind, but at least it will sync to the Spark 3 so you can easily view your latest runs on the move without needing the PC link. \nWhat's really missing from both is any sort of training programme. If you're targeting a 10km or half-marathon, it would be great to have access to training programmes to simply and easily use the Spark to guide you and monitor your weekly build-up and taper for effective training. Pocket-lint \nSadly, you'd have to manually manage this process, although the Spark does have a number of races available, as well as the ability to set distance or time goals to guide the run you're about to head out on. \nThe app will at least let you nominate connections to various other tracking platforms, so you can share your efforts with NikePlus, Strava, Endomondo, MapMyFitness, MyFitnessPal, TrainingPeaks and others. There's no Fitbit on that list, but you can sync Fitbit with MyFitnessPal to get your data through. TomTom Spark 3 review: Different watch versions \nWe've been using the TomTom Spark 3 Cardio + Music. This is TomTom's top device and the complete package, as you get the Bluetooth headset in the box (more on that in a minute). It also commands a lofty £249 price point, which sounds a little high, but it does offer a wide range of features. \nHere's how the TomTom Spark 3 models break down. All models offer GPS tracking, 24/7 activity tracking, different sport tracking and the new route trace feature.",

"text": "e-mail \nView \ncomments\nOutraged Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday grilled the head of pharmaceutical company Mylan about the significant cost increase of its life-saving EpiPens and the profits for a company with sales in excess of $11 billion. \nDefending the company's business practices, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that she wishes the company had 'better anticipated the magnitude and acceleration' of the rising prices for some families. \n'We never intended this,' Bresch said, but maintained that her company doesn't make much profit from each emergency allergy shot. \nThe list price of EpiPens has grown to $608 for a two-pack, an increase of more than 500 percent since 2007. \nFamilies who rely on multiple EpiPens to respond when their children have allergic reactions, whether at home or at sporting events, have lashed out at Mylan in growing public outcry. \nMylan CEO Heather Bresch testifies before the House Oversight Committee hearing on EpiPen price increases on Wednesday\nHouse Oversight Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said high executive pay at Mylan 'doesn't add up for a lot of people' as the EpiPen price has increased. \nChaffetz said executives for the company made $300 million over five years while the list price for a pair of the emergency allergy shots rose. \n'Parents don't have a choice,' Chaffetz said. 'If your loved one needs this, it better darn well be in your backpack.' \nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Poor students who are the 'minority' at schools in wealthy...

Share this article Share Bresch, who displayed an EpiPen, said the company makes only $50 in profit on each EpiPen. But Chaffetz said he finds that 'a little hard to believe.' \nThe soft-spoken CEO patiently listened to criticism after criticism from lawmakers of both parties, but found no sympathy in the room. In response to one question, Bresch acknowledged that she made $18 million in salary last year. \n'Sounds like you're doing pretty well on this,' said Rep. John Mica, R-Fla. \nThe list price of EpiPens has grown to $608 for a two-pack, an increase of more than 500 percent since 2007 \nWhen asked if she understood what the furor was about, she argued that the complexity of drug pricing is partially to blame. \n'I truly believe the story got ahead of the facts,' Bresch said. \nEpiPens are used in emergencies to stop anaphylaxis, the potentially fatal allergic reactions to insect bites and stings and foods like nuts and eggs. \nPeople usually keep multiple EpiPens handy at home, school or work, but the syringes, prefilled with the hormone epinephrine, expire after a year. \nThe company says it has made strides to more widely distribute the drug to schools and others and raised awareness of deadly allergies. That requires investment, Bresch said. \nThe Mylan executive has some familiarity with Capitol Hill — she is the daughter of Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. But lawmakers so far haven't given any deference to her, and several other committees have called for investigations into the price increase. \nBresch noted that Mylan has said it will begin selling its generic version for $300 for a pair. That will still bring Mylan tens of millions of dollars in revenue while helping retain market share against current and future brand-name and generic competition. \nMylan CEO Heather Bresch points to her chart to help her answer questions while testifying\nMylan CEO Heather Bresch holds up an EpiPen while testifying on Capitol Hill in Washington\nChaffetz said he was skeptical that the company will lose any money on the generic versions. \n'This is why we don't believe you,' he said. \nThe company has also offered coupon cards and has doubled the limit for eligibility for its patient assistance program. But critics have said the coupons, discount cards and patient assistance programs aren't real solutions because many customers won't use them or won't qualify for them. \nRepublican Rep. Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee, a physician, told Bresch that she was 'trying to make us feel good' about the generic version and other programs, but that he doesn't feel good about it. \n'A mother would cut off her right arm to get that drug. You chose to charge her $600 instead of cutting off her arm,' DesJarlais said. 'Lower the price so they can afford it.' \nLast year, more than 3.6 million U.S. prescriptions for two-packs of EpiPens were filled, according to data firm IMS Health. That brought in sales of nearly $1.7 billion for Mylan, though the company says it only receives about $1.1 billion after rebates and fees paid to insurers, distributors and other health care businesses. \nIn the Senate, leaders of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs' investigations subcommittee said earlier this month that they have begun an inquiry into the company's pricing and competition practices. The Aging Committee requested briefings on the issue, and Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has written several letters to Mylan demanding answers.",

Follow @EconomiaECpe \n\nEl ejecutivo indicó que ya hubo reuniones en los últimos meses con empresas peruanas y extranjeras que demostraron \"gran interés\" por el proyecto, consistente en trasvasar el agua del río Huancabamba mediante un túnel de 20 kilómetros que atraviesa los Andes hasta los valles desérticos de la región de Lambayeque. \nPinillos aseguró que un requisito para las empresas interesadas en adquirir la concesión es que no solo tengan el nivel técnico para poder operarlo sino también la calificación económica y financiera suficiente como para continuar con las operaciones de trasvase e irrigación. \n\"Nos sentimos realmente orgullosos de haber puesto el proyecto en desarrollo y ahora vemos que está en una etapa de maduración porque los principales retos para su viabilidad, que eran la construcción del túnel transandino y la estructuración económica y financiera, fueron solventados\", dijo Pinillos. \nEl director de H2Olmos recordó que la inversión realizada por la concesionaria alcanzó los 600 millones de dólares entre la construcción de la presa, el túnel y los canales y sistemas de riego que abastecen de agua a los campesinos locales y a los fundos subastados a empresas peruanas y extranjeras. \nEl gerente indicó que el 30 % de la superficie agrícola del proyecto, correspondiente a 12.000 hectáreas, ya está en producción, y estimó que generará unos 30.000 puestos de trabajo directos y 100.000 indirectos cuando alcance la plena producción de las 43.500 hectáreas, dentro de cuatro o cinco años. \nPinillos añadió que el valor anual de la producción agrícola de Olmos rondará los 650 millones de dólares, entre la caña de azúcar que se procesará para el mercado local y las frutas y hortalizas que se exportarán a mercados de Norteamérica y Europa inicialmente. \n\"Creo que se presenta una gran oportunidad para abastecer los mercados del hemisferio norte. Se han logrado cultivos como el aguacate y el arándano, que se cultivaban en zonas más frías como Chile y Argentina y que ahora se desarrollan en el norte peruano\", añadió. \nEl ejecutivo valoró la inversión realizada en Olmos por el grupo peruano Gloria al construir una planta para refinar azúcar, valorada en unos 300 millones de dólares, que es \"la más moderna del país, y que permitirá a Perú dejar de importar azúcar para convertirse en un productor con superávit\" en este sector. \nPinillos afirmó que el progreso del proyecto hace que se presente como un atractivo la posibilidad de desarrollar la segunda etapa, consistente en aumentar la presa Limón, que abastece el túnel del trasvase, para cuadruplicar la capacidad de su embalse y doblar la superficie de cultivos hasta las casi 100.000 hectáreas. \nValoró además que el Ministerio de Transporte y Comunicaciones (MTC) ya tiene un proyecto para impulsar junto al Gobierno regional de Lambayeque una carretera asfaltada que facilite la salida de los productos para la exportación, además de la construcción de la nueva ciudad de Olmos, aledaña a los fundos, para 70.000 habitantes. \nEl proyecto Olmos está ubicado cerca del municipio del mismo nombre, a unos 900 kilómetros al norte de Lima, y su trasvase fue concesionado a CTO, otra empresa del grupo Odebrecht, en 2004 por veinte años, mientras que la irrigación fue concesionada en 2010 a H2Olmos por un período de 25 años. \nEntre las 43.500 hectáreas que componen el proyecto hay 5.500 que pertenecen a campesinos comuneros del Valle Viejo de Olmos y 38.000 corresponden a las tierras subastadas para la agricultura a gran escala",

"title": "What is Google Assistant, how does it work, and when can you use it?",
"text": "Comment Google recently introduced a new product that aims to take on Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. It's likely that the company will use its 4 October event to further highlight how we can expect to use it on a daily basis on our Android phones and other Google-powered devices. \nCalled Google Assistant, it's basically an extension of Google Now. Google unveiled Google Assistant at its annual Google I/O developer conference in May 2016, pitching the new virtual assistant as an improvement of the two-way conversation experience in Google Now. If you'd like to know more, including how Google Assistant works and when you'll be able to use it, we've explained all you need to know. Google Assistant: What is it? \nGoogle Assistant is Google's latest iteration of a virtual assistant. It's considered an upgrade or an extension of Google Now. During the main keynote at Google I/O 2016, Google’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, demoed Google Assistant and said he wanted people to experience \"an ongoing two-way dialog” with the virtual assistant. Keep in mind this virtual assistant trend kicked off in 2011, when Apple introduced Siri. \nSiri is a little helper that can do things like set your alarm, answer questions about weather and sports scores, and make you giggle with a joke or two. Two years after it debuted on iPhone, Google introduced Google Now for Android. It's not audible or personal like Siri, but it can serve up cards with information pulled from Google.com. Google Now can also scan your emails for package tracking, calendar events, and more. \nGoogle Now is also heavily integrated into Android, sort of like Siri with iOS. Skip forward another year to 2014, and Amazon jumped on board with its own assistant called Alexa. It can be found in the company's connected Bluetooth speaker. In our review of the device , which is called Amazon Echo, we praised Alexa's ability to audibly answer questions, hail an Uber, order Dominos pizza, and control connected devices. \nUnlike Siri and Google Now, Alexa isn't limited to Android or iOS. Anyway, because of Alexa, Amazon Echo has become so popular that Amazon can't keep it in stock and has since launched two other versions. Google obviously noticed this, because at Google I/O 2016, it unveiled a similar connected speaker called Google Home. Arguably, the standout feature of Google Home is that it has Google Assistant. \nHere's how Google explained its new assistant: \"The assistant is conversational - an ongoing two-way dialogue between you and Google that understands your world and helps you get things done. It makes it easy to buy movie tickets while on the go, to find that perfect restaurant for your family to grab a quick bite before the movie starts, and then help you navigate to the theater.\" \nYou can learn more about Google Assistant from here . Google Assistant: How does it work? \nThe thing to remember about Google Assistant is that it is conversational. That means you can ask a question and then ask several follow-up questions, and Google Assistant will be able to keep track of the conversation, determine context, and audibly respond with the right information. Not much is known about Google Assistant, but we do know it is coming to two new Google products: Google Home and Allo. \nGoogle Home \nGoogle Home is a Wi-Fi speaker that also works as a smarthome control center and an assistant for the whole family. You can use it to playback entertainment throughout your entire house, effortlessly manage every-day tasks, and ask Google what you want to know. Google Home is able to do much of these things thanks to Google Assistant. \nUsing artificial intelligence and machine learning, Google Assistant can determine context with your questions. For instance, when you ask \"What's playing tonight?\", Google Assistant can show films at your local cinema. If you then follow up with \"We're planning on bringing the kids\", Google Assistant will know to serve up showtimes for kid-friendly films. You can even say \"Let's see Jungle Book\" to purchase tickets. \nYou could also ask \"Is Jungle Book any good\", and then the assistant will display reviews, ratings, and a trailer. Notice Google Assistant is able to string your questions together in order to determine context and serve up the right information. It can also do basic stuff like retrieve your travel itinerary, daily schedule, commute time to work, package delivery information, and more. \nYou can read all about Google Home from here . \nAllo \nAllo is Google's new smart chat app. The messenger has started its roll out on Android and iOS and is designed to give you plenty of options when it comes to chatting to your friends. \nGoogle introduced the new app at Google I/O 2016. Rather than just giving you a straight-down-the-line messaging app, Allo makes chat more fun and interactive. It's based on your phone number - like WhatsApp - and seems to be going after all the popular chat apps, with emoji, stickers, and more. What is Google Allo, how does it work, and why would you use it? \nOne of its hottest features is Google Assistant. Google basically took the virtual assistant and bots like what you'd find in Facebook Messenger and rolled them all into one product. \nIn Allo, you can to ask it questions by either typing \"@google\" and then asking your question or by using your voice to dictate. Google Assistant then responds. Again, this is all conversational, so you can ask follow-up questions and the clever bot remains contextually aware. \nYou can ask practically anything you'd type in to Google Search or Maps, including asking it to find you a place to eat nearby or how many Euros are in a number of Pounds. You can interact with it by asking it to tell you something interesting, show you something funny, or show a video about something specific, and it all shows up within the chat you're in. You don't need to leave the app. \nOne of the cool features is the in-chat game. Type \"@google let's play a game\" and you'll get the option to play emoji based trivia games. \nLike it can in Google Home, Google Assistant can also do tasks, such as get you movie times and purchase tickets for you. You will also have access to Google's 17 years of search experience. That allows you to ask specific questions such as \"How much fat is in an avocado?\" or \"What is Draymond Green's jersey number?\" Those types of questions will stump Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri, but not Google Assistant. \nThe app also features an incognito mode so that you can make your conversations more private, and even set them to self-destruct within a specified amount of time. \nThird-party integrations \nGoogle Home can be a control center for your entire home because it has access to the Google Assistant. It will let you do things like set alarms and timers and manage to-do lists and shopping lists. It will also connect your smarthome and support popular network systems. That means you will be able to control smart lights, switches, doors, etc (including Google's own Nest products). \nGoogle said it plans to work with developers so you can control things beyond the home too, such as booking a car, ordering a dinner, or sending flowers to a loved one. And the best part is you will be able to do this with just your voice. Keep in mind a report surfaced earlier this week claiming Apple also wants to open Siri to third-party developers and create a own Siri-powered speaker. \nAlexa, on the other hand, is already available through Echo and offers a slew of integrations with Spotify, Uber, Dominos, Philips, Belkin, IFTTT, and more. In order to get a leg up on Alexa, we think Google will have to launch Google Assistant with as many integrations as possible. Google Assistant: When can you use it? \nYou can use it right now in the Google Allo app, but as we already mentioned it will be available elsewhere throughout Google's ecosystem, probably sometime after the 4 October launch event which will also be used to launch the new Pixel phones, 4K Chromecast and Google Home router. \nWe don't know yet if Google Assistant replacing Google Now, or running alongside it. It seems sensible to have just the one new product do everything that Now does, and more.",

"text": "Bahamas ha sido durante años una de las jurisdicciones favoritas para ocultar dinero o bienes a haciendas y autoridades nacionales. Hasta 2001 la OCDE consideraba este país un paraíso fiscal y sigue siendo uno de los centros offshore que más se resisten a adecuarse a las normas internacionales contra el blanqueo.  [Lea Las claves de la investigación]Además del caso de Neelie Kroes, políticos y personajes del mundo del espectáculo en todo el mundo han aprovechado esta situación para utilizar las sociedades offshore, verdadero músculo financiero del país.Amber RuddQuién es: Ministra del Interior en Reino Unido desde julio de 2016 en el nuevo gobierno ‘tory’, cuando sustituyó a Teresa May en el cargo. Tras su llegada al Parlamento en 2010, ha pasado por varios cargos en el Ministerio de Energía y Cambio Climático. Antes de 2005, año en el que presentó su primera candidatura con los conservadores, trabajó en fondos de capital de riesgo en Londres.  Qué hace en Bahamas: Amber Rudd aparece relacionada con dos sociedades: Advanced Asset Allocation Fund Limited y Advanced Asset Allocation Management Limited, a ambas desde finales de los años 90. En ese momento, Bahamas era todavía considerado un paraíso fiscal por la OCDE.  Contactada por los medios del Consorcio, Rudd no ha ofrecido detalles sobre la actividad de las dos compañías offshore. Un portavoz de Rudd se ha limitado a decir que “es sabido que Amber ha tenido una larga trayectoria en los negocios antes de entrar en política”.  Randy De PunietQuién es: Piloto de motociclismo francés, trabaja como piloto probador para KTM. Entre 2006 y 2013 disputó el campeonato de MotoGP.Qué hace en Bahamas: Según los datos del registro de Bahamas, el piloto es director, presidente y secretario de una sociedad con su nombre, Randy De Puniet Motorsport LTD. Figura con estos cargos desde diciembre de 2014, primer año en el que este deportista dejaba de participar en las carrera para pasar a ser probador. Este diario no ha obtenido respuesta a las preguntas enviadas por su representante sobre la sociedad.  Barbara Broccoli, Michael Wilson y Andrew NoakesQuiénes son: productores cinematográficos de la serie de películas sobre James BondQué hacen en Bahamas: Bárbara Broccoli es hija de Albert Broccoli, mítico productor de cine que trabajó en la saga original de películas de James Bond. Bárbara ha seguido la estela del padre y por esa razón se encontraba en Bahamas: grabar parte de ‘Casino Royale’ en Las Bahamas. Las sociedad Bond Twenty One hace referencia justamente a la película número 21 del agente secreto 007. Se cerró en 2007, tras el estreno de la película, y es un ejemplo de uso perfectamente legal de una sociedad en las islas caribeñas.      Andrew Loog OldhamQuién es: primer manager y productor de The Rolling Stones.  Qué hace en Bahamas: este inglés, considerado el descubridor de la banda de Mick Jagger, vive en Bogotá. En el registro de Nassadu aparece por ser el Director y Presidente de Old-Pro2, Ltd., abierta entre 2009 y 2015.  Carlos Caballero ArgáezQuién es: Ministro Colombiano de Minas entre 1999 y 2001Qué hace en Bahamas: Caballero Argáez ha sido presidente y secretario de Pavc Properties Inc., registrada en Nassau, entre 1997 y 2003. También fue director de Norway Inc desde 1990 y hasta 2015. Al dejar el cargo en la primera sociedad, Enrique Vargas Lleras, hermano del actual vicepresidente de Colombia, tomó su relevo.  Norway servía para mantener una cuenta bancaria perteneciente al padre de Argáez en Miami y cuyos bienes fueron repartidos entre los hijos. La otra sociedad se utilizó para que figurara como dueña de un piso en la misma ciudad norteamericana. Las compañías se utilizaron, ha admitido Argáez, “para evitar pago de impuestos sobre las acciones”.",

"text": "When I first moved to New York, I wish I had kept a journal of all the details that felt new upon moving to the city for the first time — the pace, the lifestyles, the people, and getting lost in subway tunnels underground. Everything was different to me all at once. Moving back to Florida has not been without its own series of culture shocks.\nHere's a look at a few of the #justsouthernthings I'm still getting used to again.\n1. If you don't have a car, you're out of luck.\nAfter doing some research on public transportation in Orlando, I learned it would take me nearly two hours of transfers and waiting (in the Florida sun or rain) to get all of 5 miles north. Even with a commuter system as broken as ours, 29 million passengers used public transportation services last year. The Central Florida Regional Transportation Authority, or Lynx as it's more commonly known, has an annual operating budget of nearly $127.5 million. Compare that with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority budget of $14.6 billion, which provided services to 1.7 billion New York commuters in 2015 alone.\n2. Everything is so clean.\nNew York City is infamously filthy. Between the trash heaps and the rodent population, you get used to living with a certain level of grime.\nIn Florida, however, decency and order are the rule. The stores are impeccably organized, and the streets are pretty clean, too. I feel newly insulated in a bubble of cleanliness and comfort. I have no criticism of this, except that I feel a disconnect from humanity at some level. There's a disconnect between the haves and have-nots in New York City, certainly, but in Florida — or in the suburbs, let's say — this chasm is much wider. You don't have to think about communities that don't have clean running water in their homes because you can just avoid that area of town. You don't have to face things that make you uncomfortable because, well, the windows in your car are tinted and you don't have to make eye contact.\nCaption Interview with U.S Senate candidate Patrick Murphy - Voter Guide Full Editorial Board interview with U.S. Senate candidate Patrick Murphy.\nFull Editorial Board interview with U.S. Senate candidate Patrick Murphy.\nCaption Interview with U.S Senate candidate Patrick Murphy - Voter Guide Full Editorial Board interview with U.S. Senate candidate Patrick Murphy.\nFull Editorial Board interview with U.S. Senate candidate Patrick Murphy.\nCaption Editorial Board interview with US Senate candidate Marco Rubio Paul Owens and Michael Murphy conduct the Orando Sentinel Editorial Board interview with U.S. Senate Republican candidate Marco Rubio.\nPaul Owens and Michael Murphy conduct the Orando Sentinel Editorial Board interview with U.S. Senate Republican candidate Marco Rubio.\nCaption Editorial Board interview with U.S. Rep.

Southern hospitality can be weird.\nShopping for groceries in Manhattan at rush hour resembles a dystopian \"Lord of the Flies\" experiment sponsored by Trader Joe's. It's every man for himself. Shopping carts are compact for optimal aisle navigation; everyone has headphones in and elbows out. I went to Publix the other day, and I was in your average suburban-size aisle (see point one) when two different men said, \"Excuse me, ma'am,\" as they walked past me. I do not own the cereal aisle. Why do they need me to excuse them? They were at least two feet away from me when they passed by. How polite. Two different produce attendants then asked if I needed anything. Do you know how much eye contact these exchanges required? Do you realize how much eye contact people make in the South? What is everyone staring at all the time?\nWhich leads me to my next point …\n4. It's a village.\nNew York City has 8 million residents, and that density across 304 miles gives you an invisibility that doesn't exist here. I feel observed all of the time in Florida. I've now begun to observe others, if only because I ran into two different people from high school in the metro Orlando area of town. I went to high school 20 miles away from this region. The Cheesecake Factory is not safe; the giant Target in Millennia plaza is not safe. You will see people you know and will have to account for why you are in town and have not called them.\nGreater Orlando may have a population of 2 million people, but it's a provincial town at heart.\nThe townspeople do not use turn signals.\nAlthough I miss New York museums and ordering my usual $2 egg and cheese on a bagel each morning, Publix subs and choosing a new beach to drive to every weekend make this transition a lot easier. After all, it's still home.\nWinter Park resident, Rebecca Marie Jo, 25, is a managing editor at RELEVANT magazine and an advocate for underserved communities.

"text": "MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday lambasted the state government for its \"complete apathy\" and \"criminal negligence\" that has lead to worsening malnutrition deaths in tribal areas of Maharashtra's eleven districts, including Palghar, close to Mumbai. \n\n\"This is shocking,\" remarked a bench of Justice Vidyasagar Kanade and Justice Swapna Joshi when told by advocate Uday Warunjikar, appearing for petitioner Kasturba Adivasi Mahila Sangh, that nearly 18,000 children have died in the state during 2015-2016 financial year itself. The court is hearing a public interest litigation on malnutrition deaths. \n\nThe judges said huge amounts of funds are earmarked and yet there are malnutrition deaths taking place. \"This is criminal negligence. Every year large number of children die of negligence,\" said Justice Kanade. The judges questioned whether it is not the government's duty to ensure implementation of welfare schemes. \n\nWarunjikar informed the court about the recently reported casual response of the minister Vishnu Savara when told some 600 children had died in Palghar district. \"See the mentality,\" said Warunjikar. The court lamented the non-implementation of its orders passed since May 2010. \n\n\"We are absolutely frustrated. If this continues, we will ask the chief secretary to come here. Only if we do that, the entire machinery will work,\" said Justice Kanade. \n\nThe bench asked for a compilation of all orders so that it can issue showcause notices to the officers responsible. The government's advocate, Neha Bhide, said the core committee, formed following the HC's May 2015 order, with the chief secretary as its chairperson has held eight meetings. She submitted its report saying the government is doing everything it can to implement the schemes.",

"text": "SHARES show chapters <p>Jim Grant: The pretense of knowledge</p> <p>James Grant, Grant&#039;s Interest Rate Observer, reacts to today&#039;s Fed decision to hold rates steady.</p> 2 Hours Ago | 01:59 \nAfter the Federal Reserve opted to leave interest rates unchanged Wednesday, Jim Grant told CNBC he believes the markets are beginning to lose confidence in central banks. \n\"I think the central banks are busy chipping away at the unwarranted faith in their pretense,\" the founder and editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer said in an interview with CNBC's \" Closing Bell .\" \nThe Fed was sharply divided when it opted to not hike interest rates at its September meeting. While Fed policymakers expressed confidence in economic growth in its statement after the meeting, they said there was not enough to make a move this month. \nThey also set up the likelihood of an increase before the end of the year. \n\"The central bankers insist on paying no attention to historical precedent and insist on turning away from the fact that this is an experiment where there is no known outcome,\" Grant argued. \nHe has long been a critic of the Fed's zero-rate interest policy, saying it has distorted asset valuations. \n\"Zero rates say there is trouble. They say there is something abnormal. There is something to worry about. This is a state of high anxiety perpetuated by the central bank,\" Grant told CNBC. \nHe said one of the issues is that there has been a \"pretense of knowledge\" on the part of the members. \n\"Among the voting members today, we have seven doctors of economics who basically have been taught the same things, who think in the same format, and I think that we are the prisoners of a very dubious set of pseudo-scientific pretensions on the part of the people who manage our monetary affairs,\" he said. \n\"They will find a way not to do something for reasons that cannot be enumerated,\" he said.",

"text": "A Pennsylvania man crawled to the side of a road three days after a car crash killed his girlfriend and hurt his legs so badly that he couldn’t move.\nKevin Bell, 39, was driving an SUV that dove down an embankment off U.S. 50 in southeast Indiana and collided head-on into a tree, according to the Associated Press . His girlfriend Nikki Reed, 37, of Seymour, Indiana, was sitting in the front seat and died instantly when the SUV crashed on Saturday.\nBell suffered injuries to his legs in the crash that barred him from leaving Reed’s body or the vehicle. He finally crawled to the roadside for help, where Indiana state troopers found him near the scene. Bell was taken to a hospital and is expected to recover.\nPolice said Bell lost control of the SUV, sending it plunging down the embankment and into the tree. The vehicle was not visible from the roadway, police said.\nReed’s family reported her missing on Saturday, and according to police, Bell’s family said they hadn’t been able to contact him since Saturday. According to family members, Reed had traveled to Pennsylvania to pick up Bell.\nAuthorities are still investigating the incident.\n",

The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF closed at $67.46 on Wednesday, just shy of its 52-week intraday high of $67.68. Najarian explained that it is an attractive dividend yield play that also has growth. \nTrader Dan Nathan agreed and said that the sector could see continued growth amid merger and acquisition activity. \nDisclosures: \nDAN NATHAN \nDan Nathan is long TWTR, long PYPL call calendar, Long FEZ Nov put spread, long EEM Nov put spread, long XHB Jan put spread, long XLK Jan put spread, XLU Dec call spread. \nTIM SEYMOUR \nTim Seymour is long APC, AVP, BAC, BBRY, CLF, DO, DVYE, EDC, EWZ, F, FB, FCX, FXI, GM, GOOGL, GRMN, GE, INTC, LQD, M, MCD, MPEL, NKE, RACE, RAI, RH, RL, SINA, T, TWTR, UA, VALE, VZ, XOM and short: SPY, XRT.

"text": "World News | Wed Sep 21, 2016 | 7:08pm EDT U.S. tests for mustard agent after rocket attack near Iraq base By Phil Stewart | WASHINGTON \nWASHINGTON The U.S. military is testing to see if a chemical agent may have been used in a rocket attack in Iraq by Islamic State that came within hundreds of yards (meters) of U.S. forces but injured no one, a U.S. military official said on Wednesday. \nThe rocket fell on Tuesday in an unpopulated area near the Qayyara West base, where hundreds of U.S. forces are working to prepare an airfield ahead of Iraq's offensive to retake the city of Mosul from the radical group Islamic State, said the official, who spoke with Pentagon reporters on condition of anonymity. \nA group of U.S. forces inspected the fragments afterwards and took a small sample of a suspicious \"tar-like, black, oily\" substance, which initially tested positive for mustard agent but then tested negative in a subsequent examination, the official said. Further tests were underway. The incident was first reported by CNN. \nAs a precaution, they underwent routine decontamination procedures, including showers, but did not display symptoms that would typically show up within 12 hours of exposure. \n\"It's been more than 24 hours and we haven't seen anyone who has any indication of blistering or anything like that,\" the official said. \n\"There are absolutely no injuries. Nobody has been off their typical work schedule. It hasn't impacted the mission in any way.\" \nThe U.S. military has used air strikes to repeatedly hit Islamic State's chemical weapons stores, and experts have warned that the militant group might use the agents during the upcoming Mosul offensive. \nThe United States has also observed repeated Islamic State attacks over the past year or so against Iraqi troops, Kurdish forces and Syrian soldiers, a second U.S. official said. But the official stressed there had not been such attacks against the U.S. forces in Iraq, who number at least 4,400. \n\"I don't know of a case like this where it was proximate to U.S. forces like this before,\" the second official said. \nThe first U.S. official described the group's technical skills as crude when it came to mounting a chemical weapon attack and appeared to play down any growing concerns about a threat to U.S. forces. \n\"We have a moderate level of concern ... on a day to day basis and our concern isn't much greater after seeing this, because it falls into the expected realm,\" the official said. \nThe security protocols at the base have not changed as a result of the attack, the official said. \n(Reporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by James Dalgleish, Toni Reinhold) Next In World News",

Mandatory Credit: Kevin Sousa-USA TODAY Sports 13/13 By Frank Pingue | TORONTO \nTORONTO Team North America caught Group B favorites Sweden off guard with an explosive start before securing a thrilling 4-3 overtime win at the World Cup of Hockey on Wednesday to keep alive their hopes of reaching the semi-finals. \nSweden, who got the point they needed to secure a berth in the semi, began the eight-team tournament as a clear favorite to reach the finals but speedy Team North America wasted little time in showing they were not intimidated. \nTeam North America, an explosive mix of U.S. and Canadian players 23 and younger, scored two goals in the opening 95 seconds of the game but Sweden did not panic and twice erased two-goal deficits to force overtime. \nCanadian Nathan MacKinnon roofed the winning goal with 49 seconds to play in overtime when he was in alone deep in the Swedish zone and used a series of dekes to avoid a pokecheck from Henrik Lundqvist before backhanding the puck into the net. \n\"Johnny (Gaudreau) made a great pass to me and I just thought I'd put it away because I wouldn't have been able to backcheck, I would've been too tired,\" said MacKinnon. \n\"I was just kind of juggling the puck and I saw him trying to pokecheck me so I knew I had to toe drag him. I was just thankful it got up.\" \nMacKinnon's goal came moments after Sweden's Daniel Sedin had a chance to end the game but was denied on a breakaway. \nDespite the win by Team North America (2-1), Russia (1-1) hold the tiebreaker over the youngsters and earn the other semi-final berth if they beat Finland (0-2) on Thursday to close out Group B play. \nTeam North America, a talent-laden squad dismissed by many as gimmicky when the tournament format was announced, got off to a dream start when American Auston Matthews cashed in a rebound 30 seconds into the game. \nThey doubled their lead when American Vincent Trocheck corralled a rebound that he sent into the back of the Swedish net moments after Gaudreau missed a penalty shot. \nThe stunned Swedes finally took some of the wind out of Team North America's sails just before the midway mark of the first period when Filip Forsberg sent a puck underneath the right arm of American goalie John Gibson. \nBut Team North America restored their two-goal lead five minutes later when Gaudreau, who took off all alone from the U.S. blueline, used a nifty deke to beat a sprawled Lundqvist. \nNicklas Backstrom pulled Sweden back to within a goal later in the period when his shot ricocheted off the toe of a U.S. defenseman and into an open net with the goalie out of position. \nSweden finally tied the game when Patrik Berglund tipped a Forsberg shot into the net about seven minutes into the third period to set up a wild finish. \n(Editing by Steve Keating.)",

(Jeff Bachner/for New York Daily News) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   7:00 PM \nMamma mia! Former “Jersey Shore” star Vinny Guadagnino, and his mom, have landed their own Food Network show. \nThe series, “Vinny & Ma Eat America,” will follow the pair around the country on a culinary road trip designed to take the Staten Island family out of their comfort zone, the Food Network exclusively tells the Daily News. \nFans of MTV’s “Jersey Shore,” and the Food Network’s “The Great Food Truck Race: Family Face-Off,” already know that Guadagnino’s mom is a whiz in the kitchen. But the Sicilian-born Paola prefers traditional Italian cooking — and not much else. Vinny Guadagnino milks a cow on \"Vinny & Ma Eat America.\" (Food Network ) \nSo Guadagnino, 28, takes his mom on the road to expand her palate and try some American dishes — and experiences — she’s never had before. \nThat means sinking her teeth into Southern food like barbecue ribs and fried chicken, and learning to fly-fish, and even milk cows. Vinny Guadagnino and mom Paola give fly-fishing a shot on their new show, \"Vinny & Ma Eat America.\" (Food Network ) \nThe upcoming show doesn’t have an official premiere date yet, but you can catch a sneak peek this Sunday at 10 p.m. on the Food Network, airing right after the finale of “The Great Food Truck Race,” which also features the duo.

"text": "America’s new Soul Brother? (MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   7:00 PM \n“Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever. You take a look at the inner cities. You get no education, you get no jobs, you get shot walking down the street.” — Donald Trump \nKenansville, N.C., Sept. 20, 2016 \n\nIt’s easy to just dismiss Donald Trump when he says manifestly untrue things. Surely he knows that the murder rate in inner cities is down dramatically over the last quarter century. Here in New York, murders have plunged from more than 2,000 in 1990 to 350 last year. \nSurely he knows black Americans’ college graduation rates have surged, black incomes have risen and black unemployment rates have fallen sharply. \nSurely he knows that in the 1960s, riots literally set Detroit, Washington and other big cities on fire. And that, in the Deep South not many years before, a black man could be lynched on sight if he looked at a white woman the wrong way. \nSo is Trump just painfully ignorant? I doubt it. More likely the salesman and reality-TV vet, knows how to speak in soundbites that are catnip for mainstream media and also send microtargeted messages to other, chosen audiences. \nThe one constant since the Trump campaign’s Stephen Bannon-Kellyanne Conway makeover has been telling folks, “Trump’s not racist.” That’s their attempt to win over persuadable white voters, likely college graduates who traditionally vote Republican — and who wouldn’t be comfortable electing a racist. \nThe campaign has decided that the best way to get these people back is to show concern to the black community. So, in recent weeks, Trump has visited black churches — and tried (unconvincingly) to wash his hands of his early bedrock issue, birtherism. \nWhile Trump’s gyrations might make a few educated whites feel a bit less guilty about pulling the lever for him, other, less tolerant Southern ears just nod their heads knowingly and think, “Well, of course things are bad there — thank God Trump won’t let those conditions affect me.” \nBut I think there’s one more group listening carefully to the way Trump trashes black communities. It’s that alt-right contingent that has made up an uncomfortable part of the billionaire’s base — and which Bannon has cultivated with his Breitbart website. \nThe alt-right critique of the last few decades goes much further than the traditional conservative view that the Great Society was bad for black people because it undermined the black family and fomented dependency. The alt-right, which, of course overlaps with outright white supremacism, posits that desegregation itself has been bad for blacks and whites. \nOne leading alt-righter, Jared Taylor of the American Renaissance website, has encouraged Trump to go further in attracting white voters. “White people like your politics, Mr. Trump,” Taylor said last summer. “But white people want more than their jobs back — and maybe you can bring back a few from China and India. What they really want is their country back. The country they had in 1964.” \nWhy 1964? Wasn’t the big immigration bill that allowed more nonwhites into the country the following year? Yes, but 1964 saw the signing of the Civil Rights Act, with the Voting Rights Act soon to follow. That was the year Jim Crow ended — and for some in the white community, the beginning of the end of cultural dominance. \nTelling black people that things have never been worse — and, wink wink, were better before the civil rights movement ever began — neatly dovetails with how alt-right whites see their world. \nTo paraphrase one of Trump’s vanquished primary opponents: Let’s dispense with the myth that Donald Trump doesn’t know what he’s doing; he knows exactly what he’s doing. Which makes him, on race, perhaps the most dangerous Republican candidate to ever run for President — ever, ever, ever. \nrgeorge@nydailynews.com",

Akram Joudeh (Police Photo) \n\"Objection!\" Joudeh barked as Assistant District Attorney Michael Pasinkoff began to relay the events to Judge Kevin McGrath. \nJoudeh, who wore a white hospital gown and was covered from the waist down in a blanket, was slowly pulling his clothing up to expose his scarred gut for the camera in a video feed to Manhattan Criminal Court. \nMeat cleaver madman was in Midtown to appeal deportation notice \n\"Shh. It's my job to object,\" his court appointed lawyer Tara Collins could be heard saying to Joudeh. \nShe explained he was trying to make the judge aware of the roughly \"two dozen staples\" on his torso after a surgery. \nJoudeh was shot six times by police during the tense encounter near Madison Square Garden after he refused to drop his knife.",

"title": "Carlos Schroeder: Eleições brasileiras são literárias e carnavalescas",
"text": "facebook twitter plus whatsapp por email Foto: reprodução / reproducao No Brasil, terra das ilusões perdidas e dos fatos inusitados, as eleições sempre apresentam fortes elementos carnavalescos e literários. É preciso entender a origem do carnaval para conhecer o espírito dos nossos políticos, e a literatura pode nos ajudar nessa análise também. O carnaval brasileiro, com toda a sua pompa e alegoria, nasceu do improviso italiano. Livremente inspirado nos personagens da commedia dell¿arte (teatro calcado no exagero, no caricato e no deboche) como o pierrô, o arlequim e a colombina, a nossa maior festa popular guarda muitas similaridades com outras festas, como as burlescas eleições municipais que se aproximam. Acho até que poderíamos dividir a grande maioria de nossos políticos em pierrôs, arlequins e colombinas. Carlos Schroeder: Romance do escritor gaúcho Samir Machado é lançado pela Editora Rocco O político-pierrô é um melancólico nato, seu rosto banhado pelo luar é o mais triste. É sempre o corno da história: os eleitores não o entendem, o partido não o entende, e ele na verdade também não entende de porcaria nenhuma. Mas ele esconde sua raiva, pois acha que todos o perseguem e que deveria estar no topo do partido. O político-pierrô é como Gustave Aschenbach, personagem de Thomas Mann em A Morte em Veneza , pois mesmo conhecendo a representação perfeita da beleza e da inocência, morre mesmo é na praia. Já o político-arlequim, este servidor de muitos amos, com sua trampolinagem, trafega de partido em partido, espalhando sorrisos e prejuízos (não podemos esquecer que Dante encontrou um no oitavo círculo do inferno). Bons tempos quando o Arlequim se refugiava apenas no folclore e roubava apenas pirulitos, balas, fumo e doces, para depois geralmente escondê-los das crianças. Mas o político-arlequim é como Ricardo III, de Shakespeare, que trai e mata para chegar ao poder, e depois quer trocar tudo por um cavalo (Meu reino por um cavalo!). Bom, já o político-colombina é galinhagem pura, geralmente é aquela figura do interior que sobe alguns degraus, se deslumbra e é sempre corrompido por um político-arlequim, um puro retrato da Emma Bovary do Flaubert (liberdade e dinheiro para quem não sabe usar: morte com arsênico). Mas o \"adeus à carne\" ou \"carne vale\" é coisa séria demais para compararmos com a promiscuidade que é uma eleição no Brasil. Se o Italo Calvino ainda fosse vivo, iria partir esses políticos ao meio, para ver se sobrava alguma parte boa. Em seu livro O Visconde Partido ao Meio descreve uma batalha onde o visconde Medardo di Terralba é atingido por uma bala de canhão, que o divide em dois. As duas partes passam então a viver separadamente - uma praticando o bem e a outra cultivando o mal. Mas quando penso em eleições lembro mesmo é do escritor Robert Musil e de sua obra O homem sem qualidades , que nos mostrou como a hipocrisia foi e é o combustível da sociedade. E toda vez que vejo um candidato a prefeito sorridente na TV, ou vejo nos jornais alguém bancando o salvador da pátria, olho para o livro na minha estante e dou uma piscadinha. Musil trabalhou em sua obra-prima durante cerca de quinze anos, de 1927 até o dia de sua morte e com ela conseguiu traduzir a ânsia humana pelo poder. O livro foi proibido tanto na Alemanha quanto na Áustria (onde a história transcorre disfarçada com o nome de Kakânia), pois aponta de forma contundente a assepsia da técnica como novo paradigma da vida moderna (o problema do empobrecimento da experiência levantado por Walter Benjamin) e deixa uma grande interrogação em sua obra máxima: \"E a verdade que me ensinam será a minha verdade?\". Então, meus caros e raros leitores, quando encararem a urna eletrônica, lembrem sobretudo do carnaval. Mas não esqueçam que ainda não inventaram um Engov com duração de quatro anos e, que, provavelmente acabaremos iludidos, como o personagem Adrian Leverkühn de Doutor Fausto do Thomas Mann, pois os homens mudam de nomes, mas o diabo é sempre o mesmo.

"text": "During Tuesday's episode of The Talk , host Sheryl Underwood burst into tears while calling out police brutality and the lack of legal consequences police officers face when they unjustly kill black women and men like Terence Crutcher .\nCrutcher, a 40-year-old father of four, was stunned and shot by police officers in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Friday. Crutcher — stranded in the middle of the road in the northeast area of the city — was unarmed, had his hands raised and was walking toward his vehicle when police attacked him.\nUnderwood says a police officer should face hate crime charges when they shoot a black person.\n\"First thing you gotta do, you gotta make it a hate crime,\" Underwood said. \"You gotta put people in jail. When you shoot somebody under the cover of authority, you need to lose your job and you need to lose your livelihood and you need to lose your freedom.\"\nIn an emotional conversation, Underwood then eloquently explains that people who aren't black don't understand their fears because their lives aren't threatened when they're behind the steering wheel.\n\"Y'all white, y'all drive all the time and don't nothing happen to y'all,\" she said. \"And we black and I'm afraid to drive my damn car!\"\nHere is Underwood's full speech about racial profiling below:\nSource: YouTube",

The program is divided into various levels, and you gain points for flagging content, adding captions or sharing knowledge . At Level 2, you can join in on ‘exclusive workshops’ and participate in video chats with other heroes. At Level 3, you can mass flag videos and delete user comments like a champ.",

"text": "show chapters\nBest for economy: Clinton or Trump?\nFormer Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm and Former Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Georgia) discuss the economic plans of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.\nBest for economy: Clinton or Trump? Friday, 12 Aug 2016 | 11:26 AM ET | 02:15 Keep an eye on the stock market between now and the presidential election: There's a very good chance investors will point the way to the winner.\nIn fact, since 1944 the behavior of the S&P 500 has been an excellent indicator of who will win the White House.\nLooking specifically at this year's contest, a rising market between Aug. 1 and Oct. 31 would favor Democrat Hillary Clinton , while a decline would point to victory for Republican nominee Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election.\nThat's based on an analysis of how the market performed compared to which party at that time held the Oval Office.\nFor instance, the indicator worked in 1948 during the race between incumbent Democrat Harry S. Truman and Republican challenger Thomas Dewey. The S&P 500 rose 4.4 percent during the period in question, correctly indicating that the party in power would retain the White House, according to data provided by Sam Stovall, U.S. equity strategist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nOne of the few times it failed was in 1968. That was during the race between Democrat Hubert H. Humphrey and Republican Richard M. Nixon. The index rallied a healthy 3.9 percent in the August-to-October period, but Humphrey failed to take the baton from Lyndon B. Johnson and hold onto the presidency.\nIn all, the market has predicted the winner by party of 15 of the last 18 elections — an 83 percent success rate. The chart below shows how the pattern has played out over time. (The winner is in capital letters, while (i) denotes the incumbent party.)\nThe market's crystal ball Year Democrat Republican S&P 500 % return (Oct.-Nov.) Correct party indicator? 1944 ROOSEVELT (i) Dewey 0.6 Yes 1948 TRUMAN (i) Dewey 4.4 Yes 1952 Stevenson (i) EISENHOWER -3.5 Yes 1956 Stevenson EISENHOWER (i) -7.7 No 1960 KENNEDY Nixon (i) -3.8 Yes 1964 JOHNSON (i) Goldwater 2 Yes 1968 Humphrey (i) NIXON 5.8 No 1972 McGovern NIXON (i) 3.9 Yes 1976 CARTER Ford (i) -0.5 Yes 1980 Carter (i) REAGAN 4.8 No 1984 Mondale REAGAN (i) 10.2 Yes 1988 Dukakis BUSH (i) 2.6 Yes 1992 CLINTON Bush (i) -1.3 Yes 1996 CLINTON (i) Dole 10.2 Yes 2000 Gore (i) BUSH -0.1 Yes 2004 Kerry BUSH (i) 2.6 Yes 2008 OBAMA McCain (i) -23.6 Yes 2012 OBAMA (i) Romney 2.4 Yes Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence While some of these indicators can be fairly coincidental rather than causative, this one is pretty intuitive. A rising market generally is indicative of a broader upbeat sentiment. Voters are thus more reticent to make change. The S&P 500 is up about 0.4 percent in August, though it was down fractionally Friday .\n\"We all love to say the market hates uncertainty. If the market is going up the implication is that the market believes that there will not be uncertainty through the change of platform,\" Stovall said in a phone interview. \"Hillary has said 'I plan to maintain the Obama platform,' so she is much more of a known quantity.\"\nOf course, investors also could be buying in anticipation of a Trump presidency that would revert much of Obama's policies . But the current polling numbers don't support that thesis .\nFresh results from NBC News/ Wall Street Journal /Marist polls show Clinton building substantial leads in the key battleground states of Colorado, Virginia, North Carolina and Florida. The Real Clear Politics national average puts Clinton's lead at 6.3 points.\nAnother reason the market may have some momentum — up 1.4 percent over the past month and 4 percent since July 1 — is that investors simply aren't banking on many major changes from either candidate in the most important area: monetary policy.\nIf Clinton is intent on building on the Obama agenda, then she's unlikely to appoint Federal Reserve members who would want to raise interest rates. And Trump has been explicit: He plans on funding his ambitious infrastructure and military buildup with generous levels of debt dependent on a dovish central bank.\nThe Fed has raised rates just once over the past 10 years and isn't expected to enact another hike until at least mid-2017. Historically, easy monetary policy has coincided with a 225 percent bull market run over the past 7 ½ years, meaning that the prospect of a continued low-rate environment is causing optimism regardless of who wins.",

Ảnh: Reuters Tại Philippines, chế độ độc tài kéo dài suốt hai thập kỷ của tổng thống Ferdinand Marcos chấm dứt năm 1986 đã mở ra một tương lai đầy biến động. Chính phủ mới của tổng thống Corazon Aquino phải đối mặt với hàng loạt thách thức, từ âm mưu đảo chính trong giới quân đội đến các cuộc nổi dậy đòi cải cách do những người biểu tình đầy giận dữ tiến hành. Philippines bị bao trùm bởi hàng loạt vấn đề như tham nhũng, tội phạm, kinh tế trì trệ, bạo loạn..., theo Atlantic. 'Thành phố sát nhân' Năm 1987 và 1988, phóng viên Sheila Coronel có cơ hội đến Davao, thành phố bên bờ biển phía nam tỉnh Mindanao, Philippines, để tác nghiệp. Coronel đã chứng kiến cảnh Davao chìm trong bất ổn, đói nghèo bởi những cuộc nổi dậy cùng tình trạng mất trật tự xã hội do luật lệ lỏng lẻo. Nơi đây trở thành vùng đất màu mỡ cho tội phạm phát triển. Đường phố chật kín các trạm kiểm soát. Tuy nhiên, chúng vẫn không thể ngăn tội phạm bắn giết lẫn nhau, thậm chí bắn cả cảnh sát, ngay giữa ban ngày. Năm 1985, tạp chí Asia Week còn gọi Davao là \"thành phố sát nhân\". Tối muộn một ngày tháng 9/1988, Coronel cùng đồng nghiệp lái xe quanh Davao cùng thị trưởng mới được bầu Rodrigo Duterte, để cùng tìm hiểu về những chính sách ông đề ra nhằm thay đổi bộ mặt thành phố. Ông Duterte sôi nổi nói về những thách thức trong việc duy trì trật tự ở Davao. Ông kể mình từng đích thân tới bệnh viện và ngắt máy thở của một tên tội phạm buôn bán ma túy bị thương nặng. Người đồng nghiệp đi cùng Coronel còn nhắc tới một câu chuyện khác về việc Duterte có lần khẳng định chắc nịch ông đã ném một kẻ buôn ma túy ra khỏi trực thăng. Không ai có thể kiểm chứng tính chính xác trong những mẩu chuyện này. Song, Coronel biết rõ một điều là chúng ít đáng sợ hơn rất nhiều những thứ ông nghe từ các ngõ ngách ở Davao. Hồi tháng 5, ông Duterte, người giữ chức thị trưởng Davao suốt 21 năm, đắc cử trở thành Tổng thống Philippines. Ông tuyên bố sẽ quét sạch tội phạm ma túy chỉ trong 6 tháng đầu nhiệm kỳ bằng những biện pháp cứng rắn chưa từng thấy. Đến nay, chiến dịch chống ma túy do Tổng thống Duterte khởi xướng đã khiến gần 3.000 người thiệt mạng chỉ sau ba tháng. Dù bị cộng đồng quốc tế cùng các nhóm nhân quyền chỉ trích, ông Duterte không có ý định lùi bước. \"Tôi sẽ không dừng lại cho tới khi kẻ buôn ma túy cuối cùng trên đường phố Philippines bị tiêu diệt\", Tổng thống Duterte hôm 19/9 tuyên bố. \"Tôi sẽ giết tất cả những tên trùm ma túy. Không thương tiếc\". Đối với ông Duterte và những người ủng hộ, Davao, thành phố từng bị gán mác \"cái nôi\" của tội phạm ma túy nay chuyển mình thành khu vực yên bình bậc nhất Philippines, là minh chứng rõ nét nhất cho thấy tính hiệu quả của phương pháp đấu tranh diệt tội phạm mà Tổng thống Philippines theo đuổi. Theo Coronel, ông Duterte đã đặt cược sinh mạng chính trị vào giả định rằng nếu người dân Davao có thể trả cái giá đắt đến thế để đổi lấy ổn định và trật tự thì toàn bộ dân chúng Philippines cũng hoàn toàn có khả năng làm điều tương tự. Nhưng thành công ở Davao không tự nhiên đến. Để xác lập lại trật tự, ông Duterte đã phải ban hành hàng loạt chính sách kiểm soát chặt chẽ, ví dụ như áp đặt lệnh giới nghiêm đối với trẻ vị thành niên, hay cấm bán rượu về đêm. Không giống như hầu hết những địa phương khác trên cả nước, các quy tắc giao thông cũng như luật lệ trong thành phố được thực thi rất nghiêm chỉnh. Một số nhóm nhân quyền nói ông Duterte đã ra lệnh thành lập cái gọi là Biệt đội Tử thần Davao, tập hợp những tên côn đồ, cựu binh sĩ và cảnh sát, thực hiện nhiệm vụ truy quét tội phạm. Từ năm 1998 đến 2015, biệt đội trên bị cáo buộc giết hại hơn 1.400 tên tội phạm, thậm chí cả trẻ em, trên đường phố Davao. Tuần trước, một người đàn ông tên Edgar Matobato xác nhận trước Thượng viện Philippines rằng ông ta từng là thành viên thuộc Biệt đội Tử thần Davao. Biệt đội thành lập năm 1988, ngay sau khi ông Duterte lên làm thị trưởng. Matobato cho biết ông cùng các thành viên biệt đội khác được thành phố trả tiền. Họ có nhiệm vụ tiêu diệt những kẻ tình nghi buôn bán ma túy, hiếp dâm, cướp giật. Matobato thêm rằng ông có lần còn phải chặt xác các nạn nhân rồi cho cá sấu ăn hay chôn xác họ trong hầm mỏ. Ông Duterte phủ nhận, gọi chúng là \"những lời cáo buộc từ một kẻ điên\". Định hình phong cách Tổng thống Philippines Rodrigo Duterte. Ảnh: AP Theo các chuyên gia, những biện pháp quyết liệt ông Duterte theo đuổi được định hình từ quãng thời gian ông làm thị trưởng Davao. Chúng đang cộng hưởng với tâm lý lo âu bên trong xã hội Philippines. Nhiều người dân hiện vẫn không tin tưởng vào bộ máy chính quyền cũng như các cơ quan thực thi pháp luật. Năm ngoái, kết quả từ một cuộc thăm dò trên phạm vi cả nước cho thấy dù tỷ lệ tội phạm đã giảm, tâm lý bất an vẫn hiện hữu. Philippines chưa thể bị liệt vào danh sách quốc gia tội phạm nhưng hoạt động buôn bán ma túy ở đây đang tăng nhanh và chính quyền chưa thể kiềm chế vấn nạn này, chuyên gia đánh giá. Trên khắp cả nước, từ tầng lớp nghèo khó đến trung lưu, ai cũng lo lắng về vấn nạn ma túy. Thế nhưng đa phần tầng lớp tinh hoa chính trị truyền thống lại tỏ rõ thái độ thờ ơ, đồng thời bất lực trong việc giải quyết những vấn đề đang nhức nhối trong xã hội. Vì thế, việc chiến dịch tuyên chiến với tội phạm ma túy mà ông Duterte phát động nhận được sự hưởng ứng từ dân chúng là điều không mấy bất ngờ, Coronel nhận xét. Theo giới quan sát, để thấu hiểu động lực khiến ông Duterte kiên quyết theo đuổi các biện pháp cứng rắn trong cuộc chiến chống ma túy, cần quay trở về thời điểm ông bắt đầu dấn thân vào chính trường. Ở Davao đầu những năm 1980, cuộc đấu đá của các thế lực chính trị biến thành phố thành một chiến trường thực sự. \"Phải tận mắt chứng kiến bạn mới tưởng tượng ra được sự hỗn loạn lúc bấy giờ\", Coronel chia sẻ. Cả thành phố bị khủng bố bởi những \"đội dân phòng\" mang theo dao và súng, liên tục tuần tra các con đường. Davao khi ấy không khác gì một bãi thử nghiệm những chiến lược chống nổi dậy, ông cho biết thêm. Giữa tình cảnh hỗn loạn, ông Duterte nổi lên như là niềm hy vọng duy nhất của thành phố. Chỉ trong vài năm, ông đã gặt hái thành công trong việc ổn định tình hình chính trị ở Davao. Những chính sách ông Duterte áp dụng khiến giới tinh hoa trong thành phố hài lòng bởi nhờ thế mà công việc kinh doanh của họ mới có điều kiện phát triển. Ông giữ mối quan hệ hòa hoãn với những phần tử ly khai Hồi giáo và nhận được sự ủng hộ từ các tổ chức phi chính phủ nhờ những chương trình hỗ trợ người nghèo. Giờ đây, Davao đã hóa thân thành một trung tâm du lịch và thương mại ổn định bậc nhất Philippines. Tuy nhiên, nhiều người cho rằng ông Duterte khó lòng thành công nếu thiếu vắng lực lượng quy tụ những tay súng bịt mặt vô danh thường được biết đến với cái tên Biệt đội Tử thần. Thách thức Xác hai người bị cảnh sát bắn chết trên đường phố Philippines được chuyển đi bằng xe đẩy. Ảnh: Reuters Giới chuyên gia nhận định Tổng thống Duterte dường như đang đặt cược những sách lược ông thực thi ở Davao sẽ phát huy tác dụng trên toàn Philippines. Nhưng đây chính là căn nguyên của vấn đề. Việc quản lý một quốc gia với 100 triệu người khó khăn hơn rất nhiều so với xử lý vấn đề của một thành phố dân số dưới hai triệu. Ngoài những bất ổn chính trị còn bám rễ từ sau sự sụp đổ của chính quyền tổng thống Marcos, Philippines ngày nay còn phải đối mặt với một loạt thách thức khác như nền văn hóa đa nguyên chính trị, nền báo chí hung hăng và một xã hội dân sự nhiều biến động. Ở Davao, ông Duterte không phải đau đầu vì những chính sách đối ngoại. Nhưng với tư cách Tổng thống Philippines, mọi chuyện phức tạp hơn thế nhiều lần, Coronel nhận định. Chiến dịch truy quét tội phạm ma túy do Tổng thống Duterte khởi xướng, cho phép giết người không qua xét xử, dù nhận được đồng thuận từ một bộ phận người dân nhưng lại đang bị thế giới lên án mạnh mẽ, đe dọa tới uy tín của ông trên trường quốc tế. Mặt khác, với tư cách một tổng thống, mọi tuyên bố ông Duterte đưa ra đều đòi hỏi phải có sức nặng, gần như tương đương với một chính sách chính thống. Nhưng ông Duterte lâu nay vẫn nổi tiếng với hình ảnh một tổng thống bạo miệng. Và đây chính là vấn đề hóc búa đối với ông vào lúc này. Theo Coronel, nếu điều chỉnh giọng điệu thâm trầm hơn, ông sẽ đánh mất hình ảnh mạnh mẽ mà mình gây dựng bấy lâu. Nhưng nếu kiên quyết giữ thái độ như từ trước tới nay, ông Duterte cần nhanh chóng tìm ra cách để những phát ngôn bạo miệng không làm nảy sinh xung đột trong các vấn đề nhân quyền, chính sách đối ngoại hay gây chia rẽ với công đồng quốc tế \"Ông ấy đang ở giữa một vùng lãnh thổ mới. Sách lược Davao không còn phù hợp. Đến lúc viết một cuốn sách khác rồi\", Coronel nhận định.",

"text": "NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Many people have been trying to eat healthy with less bad fat, and more good fats like olive oil, but that might not be enough.\nAs CBS2’s Dr. Max Gomez explained, a new study found that — for women at least — what’s happening in life might be more important than what’s on the plate.\nAfter getting home from school, and before starting their homework, Joanne Drew said it’s common for her kids to crave certain comfort foods.\nAfter all, days can be long and stressful even at their age.\n“When you’re stressed you feel out of control so what you try to do is be in control and to be in control you eat,” she said.\nIn an effort to keep her family fit Joanne looks for healthier ingredients in food whenever she can.\nA new study suggested that in stressful situations that may not be as helpful as you might think.\n“What this tells us is that stress really does interact with the type of food you’re eating,” Dr. Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, Ohio State Wexner Medical Center said.\nDr. Janice Kiecolt-Glaser led the study at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. To see how stress impacts diet, researchers fed 58 women two different meals.\n“One was a meal that was high in saturated fat, another was high oleic sunflower oil, that’s a healthier oil, obviously, than saturated fat,” she said.\nAfter women ate the meal with saturated fat, blood tests showed their inflammation levels were higher. After healthier meals they were lower.\nThen, researchers added stress into the equation.\n“To our surprise, if women had a stressor the day before their meal, the type of fat didn’t matter,” Dr. Martha Belury explained.\nIn fact, healthier types of fat had no benefit for women who were stressed. Their inflammation markers remained elevated.\n“That’s important because those markers are associated with a variety of age-related diseases like cardiovascular disease, diabetes,” Dr. Kiecolt-Glaser said.\nIt can even be linked to some forms of cancer. If you want to get the most out of a healthy diet, a key ingredient is managing stress.\nOf course, this doesn’t mean giving up on healthy eating, it means we have to all work on lowering our stress levels which may be easier to say than to actually do — but now we know why it’s so important.\nThe study also gave doctors a clue as to how stress leads to chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes.\n ",

"text": "Tweet \nIn the sunny and shady kingdom of Thailand, old kickboxers never die; they just fade away. \nYes, it’s been an awful month for the noble art of Muay Thai. Another week goes by and yet another lofty figure from the golden era of the competitive sport goes up to the great gig in the sky. Nampon Nongkeephahuyut, the knee-flogging and leg-cracking superstar of the 80s and 90s, died on September 19 th after a long battle with lung cancer and tuberculosis. He was only 47-years-old. \nA Lumpinee champion at 112llbs and 126llbs respectively, he fought Samart Payakaroon and every other top domestic fighter in his weight class from 1988 to 1996. Though he was a recognizable face and much liked superstar, his death has gone largely unnoticed by the middle class newspapers and publications of Thailand. Not so in the blue-collar sporting press of the kingdom—who published big glowing tributes to this late and much lamented knee fighter from Buriram province. \nOutside of Thailand, the iron-jawed nak muay (kickboxer) is best remembered for his two 1990 humdingers against the late Dutch legend Ramon Dekkers. Nampon, the reigning Lumpinee light-welterweight champ at the time, lost the first bout in Amsterdam and narrowly won the rematch in Bangkok on cards. The controversy of scoring judges in Thailand and Europe aside, middle-aged cab drivers in Bangkok still talk about those two momentous rucks with shock and awe reverence. It put Dekkers on the fight map in Thailand as a newly minted Songchai promoted asset, and Nampon on the radar elsewhere as one of those tough-as-nails Thais to be extremely wary of. \nStepping into a ring with Nampon was like talking a stroll in a minefield: one false step and boom! He wasn’t just accurate with those sledgehammer knees in the clinch; he was equally adept with his other fighting limbs, too. Nampon had a piston of a left jab (that usually found its mark), and was a superb kicker off either leg. His crushing and devastating leg kicks in the 1990 featherweight championship bout against the mullet headed figure of Swedish challenger Dennis Sigo immediately brings to mind the old Thai proverb, “The man who cannot stand, cannot fight.” He wiped the floor with the hapless and outclassed Swede in three memorable rounds at Oldham Leisure Center in England. It was a salutary lesson for any up and coming European kickboxer in the crowd who wanted to go head-to-head with a Thai fighter. \nAs per lessons: for MMA strikers looking to improve their mid-section knees in the clinch, look no further than Nampon’s form and fight archive on YouTube on how to (try and) do the very same to your opponents in the cage. Nampon was able to tie up boxers with his arms and break them at close proximity with big scoring knees to the ribs—which is what you are supposed to do with your opponent in the clinch, let’s face it. \nOut of the ring and beyond the fading roar of the stadium crowds, the champ’s biggest battle was to begin in retirement. An incurable lung disease struck down Nampon and he went from virile kickboxer to a stick thin has-been nursed round-the-clock by attendant family and loyal friends. It’s a salutary lesson for any would be pugilist full of his (or her) own hubris—illness makes mortals of us all, even those remote and glistening gods of the four squared ring up there on the TV set. \nAnd whilst it may be true that old nak muay have a tendency to fade away in the Kingdom of Thailand, Nampon will never be forgotten by those of us who knew him as a fighter, and those of us who knew him as a humble human being. RIP Nampon the knee flogging sensation from Buriram. His death might not be one of the headlines in the Thai press this week, but Nampon leaves this ignoble earth with the full knowledge that he did his bit for king, country and the noble art of eight limbs.",

"text": "Tweet \nIn all of MMA no one may have it worse than Cris “Cyborg.” In an era when Jon Jones can violate the USADA’s rules and the state of New Mexico’s laws and still be in the running to rule his chosen division, when the UFC will curate an entire season of The Ultimate Fighter just to find a challenger for flyweight champion Demetrious Johnson, and Conor McGregor is allowed to float to whatever weight class fits his whim even as his featherweight belt goes to seed, only Cyborg among fighters on the pound-for-pound list is forced to bend and contort and mar herself to accommodate the sport she dominates, instead of the other way around. Cursed and blessed with the body she was born with, a body designed to fight but too big to match up with any of the other great fighters of her generation, Cyborg is the living embodiment of the devil’s bargain all fighters make on a much smaller scale: Greatness can be yours for the price of your body. \nOn Monday, five days out from her fight with Lina Lansberg this Saturday in Brasilia, Brazil, Cyborg told The MMA Hour that she was still an astonishing 24 pounds over weight. Even at a catchweight of 140 pounds—five pounds over the limit of the women’s marquee bantamweight division, where all the great, legacy-defining fighters like Ronda Rousey, Holly Holm, and champion Amanda Nunes Cyborg should be fighting if the world had any justice in it reside—Cyborg is once again mauling her body just to be able to make it into the Octagon. And all to fight a woman none of us had ever heard of before this fight was announced. \nTo make matters worse, Cyborg said, in the five days since she had arrived in Brazil from the United States, she had only managed to drop three pounds, meaning there’s no trend line in her favor. Plenty of MMA fighters come into fight week with large amounts of weight to cut but rarely do they find their bodies so resistant to the task. Forget 140 pounds, Cyborg said: In this camp she’s come nowhere near 150. \n\"This camp I don't touch 150,\" she said. \"It's really scary, I look in the mirror, I trained double and I don't know why I don't touch 50. Just something different in this camp is I take birth control. Last fight, I make 140, it was successful.\" \nIn a video blog released yesterday Cyborg is seen arguing with her diet coach, famed MMA nutritionist George Lockhart, over his decision to put her on birth control in the run-up to her fight with Lansberg, something he didn’t have her do during her last agonizing but ultimately successful weight-cut, before her UFC debut in May. Cyborg says she feels like the birth control is making her retain water. She also claims the drug was banned in the United State in 2012 because it causes blot clots, and worries that it will cause her to lose strength and aggression. She wonders why birth control is even necessary when it wasn’t last time, a reasonable question for a woman putting her body through hell for a paycheck. \n“You want to improve your weight cut each time,“ Lockhart responds, before turning his attention to Cyborg’s menstrual cycle. “When you hit your period you go up 13 pounds. Your period is insane, and your mood can go through the roof. That’s something we had to address.” \n“The whole purpose behind [putting her on birth control] was the periods, make sure they’re not out of control, her moods aren’t out of control and her weight doesn’t shoot up,” Lockhart says. “That’s the biggest thing.” \nLockhart tells the film’s producers that the birth control Cyborg is taking is actually inhibiting one of the hormones preventing her from losing water weight, not enhancing it. According to an article published on Bloody Elbow yesterday (written by Iain Kidd, who is currently writing a book with George Lockhart), Cyborg’s nutritionist is right. One of the effects of drospirenone, the birth control Cyborg is likely on, is weight loss. \n“Studies show both overall weight decrease and specific effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system which Lockhart alluded to in the video,” Kidd writes. “Another study touted its benefits as a well-tolerated, effective birth control method which also aids in weight loss , especially where water retention is involved.” Kidd also points out that drospirenone was never banned in the United States or even restricted, only given a warning label after it was determined that it could slightly raise the incidence of blood clotting in non-pregnant women. \nAll of which may prove Lockhart right on the science but it also shows just how far beyond reasonable limits Cyborg is consistently dragging her body to make weight: that she’s forced to not only alter her diet but distort her menstrual cycle and her entire hormonal system. Most fighters don’t do half as much because they’re never more than 15 pounds from a more reasonable weight division. Every mixed martial artist puts his or her body through the ringer but Cyborg is the only truly great champion fighter, maybe the only truly great athlete, who has to consistently distort herself and deny the messages of her own body to ply her trade. But what else can a born fighter do when the world, her fellow fighters, and her own body are conspiring against her?",

"title": "Bahamas Leaks: Neelie Kroes, excomisaria europea de Competencia, tuvo una offshore en Bahamas.",
"text": "Neelie Kroes se ganó el apelativo de ‘Dama de Hierro holandesa’ tras su paso por la Comisión Europea. De hecho, la mano dura que empleaba contra las multinacionales, a las que pedía el estricto cumplimiento de las normas europeas para operar en los Estados miembros, la convirtió en una de las “100 mujeres más poderosas del mundo” para la revista Forbes en hasta cinco ocasiones.Lo que no se conocía, sin embargo, es que mientras cumplía su mandato como comisaria de Competencia de la Comisión Europea, entre 2004 y 2010, figuró desde el año 2000 y hasta octubre de 2009 como directora de una sociedad ‘offshore’ radicada en las Bahamas.  Esta información se desprende de los datos de más de 175.000 sociedades radicadas en las islas a los que han tenido acceso El Confidencial y La Sexta en el marco de una investigación internacional coordinada por el Suddeütsche Zeitung y el ICIJ. Todo el contenido sobre esta jurisdicción opaca se publicará a partir de hoy en una base de datos de acceso público que, además, se cruzará con los datos ya publicados de los papeles de Panamá.  [Bahamas, al descubierto: las claves de la investigación]La falta de transparencia y la ausencia de impuesto de sociedades sitúan al país en un puesto destacado entre aquellos que suponen un riesgo para el lavado de dinero, según el último informe de la Comisión Europea. Hasta hace un año, la Comisión consideraba Bahamas como una jurisdicción “no cooperadora” para intercambiar información tributaria, y nueve países siguen calificando a este país, formado por más de 700 islas, como paraíso fiscal.Tras su paso por la Dirección de Competencia, Kroes continuó su periplo europeo como comisaria de Agenda Digital, cargo que ocupó hasta 2014. En ninguna de las dos declaraciones de actividades que presentó ante la Comisión mencionó la compañía radicada en Bahamas, Mint Holdings.  Las normas europeas piden que se haga público cualquier tipo de actividad —remunerada o no— e intereses económicos relativos a los 10 años anteriores a la toma de poderes. En respuesta a las preguntas del ICIJ, Kroes ha asegurado que seguía como directora de la ‘offshore’ debido a un “descuido administrativo”, por lo cual no se la eliminó hasta 2009. La sociedad se había establecido, ha explicado su abogado, para estudiar la posibilidad de invertir en Enron. La operación nunca se llevó a cabo, asegura, debido al colapso del gigante americano de la energía.El lobby ocultoEl otro director de Mints Holdings ha confirmado las razones de la creación de la sociedad. Se trata de Amin Badr-El-Din, un hombre de negocios de Jordania amigo de Kroes desde 1994. Este empresario fundó el United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), creado para canalizar las inversiones en el sector de defensa de los Emiratos Árabes Unidos.  Es a través del UOG como Badr-El-Din y Kroes se conocieron por primera vez, de acuerdo con la documentadísima pero no autorizada biografía de la excomisaria. Ella trabajaba entonces para un consorcio de la industria armamentística holandesa e intentaba cerrar un acuerdo para vender fragatas de guerra a los Emiratos Árabes. El trato no llegó a cerrarse, pero surgió la amistad.  Tras ese encargo, Kroes asesoró a la empresa de armamentos Lockheed Martin Corp entre septiembre de 1996 y diciembre de 1997. Un cargo que también obvió en su declaración de actividades, tal y como destapó The Wall Street Journal en 2004. La empresa estaba en ese momento estrechamente ligada a Finmeccanica, el gigante italiano bajo escrutinio de la Comisión. Al haberse tratado de “una consulta para un proyecto específico”, explicó, el reglamento de la Comisión Europea no obliga a hacer públicos los trabajos de lobby o asesoramiento anteriores al cargo.[Acceda aquí al documento con el registro de Mint Holdings LTD]Un reglamento que se modificó tres veces desde 1999. “Sería fundamental, a día de hoy, que los comisarios puedan quedar por encima de cualquier posible crítica en cuanto a transparencia y ética”, ha comentado a los medios del consorcio Emily O’Reilly, actual defensora del Pueblo Europeo.  Paraísos de la UETras su paso por las comisiones de Competencia y de Agenda Digital, ha causado polémica el nombramiento de Kroes para Uber. Un fichaje abiertamente enfocado a resolver los ingentes problemas de regulación de la empresa de car-sharing. A comienzos de este mes, Kroes publicó una columna en el diario británico The Guardian donde se declaraba contraria a la sanción que Margaret Vestanger, actual comisaria de Competencia, ha impuesto a Apple.  En su mandato, la excomisaria también había conseguido reducir los beneficios fiscales de las sociedades exentas de impuestos en Gibraltar. En esa ocasión, aseguró que “la supresión de las ventajas vigentes en Gibraltar son otro paso importante hacia la eliminación de prácticas fiscales perjudiciales para los países de la UE.Bahamas, con el que España firmó un acuerdo bilateral en 2011, se resiste a firmar el acuerdo para intercambio estandarizado y automático de información tributaria exigido por la OCDE y al que se han adherido 103 países. Durante el G-20 de este verano, el Gobierno de Nassau se ha comprometido a hacerlo en 2018.  Da la casualidad de que uno de los mayores registros online de sociedades a nivel global, donde se pueden encontrar los nombres de las radicadas en Bahamas, adoptó justamente una frase de Kroes para promocionar la transparencia mercantil: “Este tipo de páginas son el tipo de herramientas digitales que necesita el mercado digital”.  *Gaby de Groot, de Het Financieele Dagblad, y Nina Selbo, del Aftenposten, han participado en la investigación del ICIJ.",

"title": "A Brutally Honest Look at Cyborg vs Rousey",
"text": "Tweet \nPhoto by Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC \nIt would be hard to tell you much that you have not already figured out about this weekend's match up between Cristiane 'Cyborg' Justino and the 6-1 UFC newcomer, Lina Lansberg. It is being fought at a catchweight of 140lbs, going no further towards proving that Cyborg can make the arduous cut to 135lbs, and Lansberg is far from a tested commodity in mixed martial arts. Add the bizarre match up between long time bantamweight belt holder, Renan Barao and the unheralded Phillipe Nover in the co-main event and this UFC event starts to look like a tune up card in front of a home crowd. \nThe women's featherweight division has always been thin on talent. For a chuckle you should visit the excellent rankings site, FightMatrix , where the magic of computers is used to score a fighter's victories and losses and remove the human element of rankings. Women's featherweight is a class in which many of the top ten have under ten fights to their name, where the 4-4 Peggy Morgan is ranked at #9, and where the #15 ranked fighter in the world has one professional fight under her belt. For extra hilarity notice that the jiu jitsu standout, Gabi Garcia, is ranked at #14 in the world at featherweight and likely hasn't weighed 145lbs since her school days. A quick check at the top of the page will reveal that Fight Matrix lists women's featherweight as 140lbs and over. That is how desperately shallow the talent pool is north of the women's bantamweight division. \nBecause of the lack of depth at women's featherweight, and even at women's bantamweight, the fight which many fans wanted to see for years was the UFC's women's bantamweight champion, Ronda Rousey, against the consensus number one female featherweight on the planet, Cristiane 'Cyborg' Justino. We won't get into the rumors and squabbling over who ducked whom, but the sticking point always seemed to be weight. Cyborg insists she can't make 135, Rousey didn't want to go up. Fair enough. But let's imagine for a moment that they did fight. Two years ago everyone seemed certain Rousey would win easily, now the opinion seems to have reversed. \nThe Inevitable Clinch \nThe clinch is everything in a Rousey bout. She has the big right hand, and she has the clinch. Once she gets a hold of her opponent it is usually a case of the harai-goshi hip throw or an armdrag or inside trip following on from that attempt. \nOne of the neater points of Rousey's game is that she often throws straight into dominant positions, rather than hitting a single or double leg takedown into some manner of guard. Indeed, Rousey will often land in a side control between her opponent's near elbow and body, the kesa-gatame or 'scarf hold'—a considerably better position for control and attack than if her opponent's elbow were closed. Bypassing the guard and moving straight from the clinch to side control, Rousey removes all the opportunities for the opponent to recall their training and return to their tight-elbowed shell. \nIt helps if you blast them in the face first too. \nThe reason that Rousey could simply walk into the clinch against everyone she fought, spare Holly Holm, is that they all attempted to throw their power hand as soon as she walked towards them. She'd occasionally slip it, more often take it, or—most often—they'd miss and suddenly they'd be in the clinch. While the jab maintains distance and keeps the body bladed, throwing the rear hand squares the body up and offers the clinch quite freely. \nThis is where the Cyborg match-up becomes so interesting. Cyborg concedes the clinch all the time. Her bread and butter is stepping in and unloading with wide right hands to the body and head. She's been doing this in a more measured fashion in recent years, but the Wanderlei Silva style flurries of hooks are still present in most of her performances. Savvy veterans like Marloes Coenen have been able to threaten her in the clinch, but even her most mediocre opposition has had success grabbing a hold of Cyborg to slow the onslaught on the feet. \nThis was among the worse shots you will see in a title fight. \nWithin the clinch it is worth considering that one of Cyborg's favorite techniques is that uranage /suplex as her opponent clutches the headlock. Headlock throw attempts have always been far more popular in women's MMA than in the men's game, but they can backfire in a number of ways even on a judoka as technically gifted as Rousey. And if you're not a Rousey level judoka? No balance breaking, no combinations? You're probably getting suplexed. That's Russian Judo. \nReaders will recall that Holly Holm had success utilizing this classic counter against Rousey on one of the occasions they clinched. On the other occasions Holm focused on getting her near arm between her and Rousey, and then making herself into a prawn along the fence, which Firas Zahabi made a great video about a couple of days after the fight. \nAgainst the overmatched competition she has been facing in Invicta, Cyborg has often been able to simply shove opponents off and keep swinging. \nThat being said, the stiff arm is grossly underrated as a counter-grappling weapon largely because of its seeming simplicity. A straight arm in the face of an opponent prevents them from securing a chest-to-chest clinch unless you either bend your elbow, your hand is deflected, or your arm somehow crumbles to dust under the force of their advance. The stiff arm was one of many methods that Holly Holm used to hinder Rousey's usual bullrush. \nHowever it is worth noting that Cyborg on the feet is stylistically the kind of fighter that Rousey always had her best success against. She plants her feet and squares her hips to throw powerful rights and wide, swinging lefts. Rousey's most exploitable shortcoming has always been her footwork. Even Bethe Correia showed how heavily Rousey commits on her right hand, her energy consuming bull rushes, and her slow turning circle in that squash match back in August 2015. \nBut Cyborg is not swift-of-foot and has never had to care about ringcraft. She stand and trades right hands, and hopes that hers turns out better—using the double collar tie to maul her opponent with knees if the chance presents itself. And that is what makes this match up so fascinating—the reliance both have on their heavy right hand and very limited concern for defense. Rousey has been susceptible as she steps in with her long jab, and in the aftermath of her right hand. Cyborg's dropping left hand opened her up to a couple of crisp counter rights by the veteran Marloes Coenen. \nBut with the way both tend to lead with their faces and jab only out of habit, the world's most high profile double knockout would certainly not be out of the question. \nIn Cyborg Santos versus Ronda Rousey you are looking at a match up which should favor the fighter who wants the clinch. Santos is not likely to make Rousey work to catch her, and when she tries to fight off the clinch it will probably be with her hands and hips, not with her footwork. But Santos is such a powerful and sizeable fighter and Rousey has never been evasive, more gritty and overwhelming. That is the key word here 'overwhelming', it is the word you would use to describe both Rousey and Cyborg. While the fight seems unlikely to ever take place there are only two real questions: how well can Cyborg cope in the clinch when she inevitably gives it away, and can Rousey do anything in the clinch if she has to take shots like these to get there? Certainly Rousey seemed to diminish in effectiveness the longer her fights went and the more knocks her confidence took. \nBut with Rousey in unofficial retirement and Cyborg fighting opponents that many fans have never heard of, it makes you wonder if the UFC are just keeping Cyborg warm as they negotiate Rousey back into action for this belated superfight. And more importantly it makes you wonder what on earth is their plan for Cyborg if Rousey cannot be tempted back into the cage?",

"text": "Tweet \nGunnar Nelson is always relaxed, but today at SBG Concorde in Dublin he seems even more laid back than usual. \nWhen a UFC fighter walks into a room everyone usually takes notice, but when ‘Gunni’ walks down the stairs from John Kavanagh’s office that overlooks the matted areas, he seems like just another body in the gigantic facility. He is abundantly at ease with the surroundings, laughing and joking before he enters the Octagon at the back of the gym for some light training in front of the gathered media. \nNelson’s affiliation with the gym is nearly ten years strong now. The fact that the Irish fans lapped up UFC’s announcement that the Icelandic fighter will headline the promotion’s return to Belfast says a lot about how they nation feel about their honorary ambassador. \nBelfast itself is familiar terrain for the submission specialist having competed in the city once in his storied career. As he can remember it, the set-up will be a little bit different in November when he headlines UFC Belfast against Dong Hyun Kim. \n“I fought once in Belfast before,” he reminisces. \n“I had only fought the weekend before and then I was offered a fight in Belfast the following week. We drove up there and I was told they had some guy that was around the same weight as me to fight. That’s how we did it back then. \n“It’s very different now. To see how much MMA has grown in Ireland and all over Europe is amazing. In my home country too, Iceland, even though it’s not legal over there at the moment and there are no shows, everyone knows the sport and watches it. Seeing that growth and being part of it, it’s amazing.” \nThe way the Irish fans have embraced Nelson is quite unprecedented. The Icelandic welterweight admits that he never saw the adoration he receives from the Irish coming, despite many people confusing him for an Irishman due to the brogue he developed from training in the country over the years. \n“It feels phenomenal,” says Nelson. “I’ve been here a long time and to get the same feeling back from them that I have for the Irish people and for Ireland makes (the Irish treating me as one of their own) feel very real to me. \n“I couldn’t have really seen it (happening). We couldn’t even see the sport being this big here either. \n“Even before I was in the UFC I could feel the big following that I had in Ireland. Actually, a lot of people thought I was Irish because I was competing here and training under John. \n“A lot of times people say I have an Irish accent. I learned how to speak in Ireland. I didn’t really speak English well until I was 17. I get it a lot when I’m in America, people thinking I’m Irish. There are a few things that I say that are very Irish.” \nNelson’s previous UFC headline bout against Rick Story ended in a loss, and even though the Mjolnir man is not bothered by his placement on the card, he is happy with his billing due to his connection with the Emerald Isle. \n“It’s awesome to have a main event here in Ireland. The last time (in a main event) it didn’t go my way, but it’s awesome to be a main event over here for me. It’s always a fight though, and I’m just getting ready to fight whoever is in front of me. Where you are on the card isn’t really important to me, it’s just about getting into that mindset.” \nPeople tuning in to the event from around the world may hear the famous Irish chorus cheering on Nelson, but he is pretty sure that Iceland will be well represented in the SSE Arena in November too. \n“I think there’s going to be a lot coming over,” he tells the scrum in front of him. \n“It’s only a short flight and (the sport) is getting bigger and bigger. It’s not a huge arena so hopefully (they will come). I’ve been getting as many tickets as I can for my friends at the gym. \n“We’ll have to see how many get tickets, but I think it’s going to be a big crowd. I think they’ll get along very well with the Irish.” \nAs far as his Korean opponent is concerned, Nelson maintained that he has done his homework on ‘Stun Gun’ and is looking forward to sharing the octagon with the exciting judo black belt. \n“I checked him out and I know him as a fighter, how he fights and his style. We’ve definitely looked at some certain situations to train. Like always, we focus on ourselves more than the opponent. That fits better with out program.” \n“He’s a great fighter and I look forward to facing him.”",
